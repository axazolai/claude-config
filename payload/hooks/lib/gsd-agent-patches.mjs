If a \`ctx_*\` (or any other MCP) tool errors as not-found / invalid parameters, its schema is
deferred — load it once via ToolSearch (\`select:<full tool name>\`, e.g.

to the raw tool just because the first call errored.

const FILESYSTEM_SEARCH_DISCIPLINE_BLOCK = `<filesystem_search_discipline>
**Never run \`find /\`, \`find ~\`, \`find $HOME\`, or any \`find\` with no starting path (defaults
to cwd but chained into a broad tree) or a drive/root path.** These sweep the entire
filesystem, run for tens of minutes, and get auto-backgrounded by the Bash tool — see
\`<background_task_hygiene>\` for why an abandoned one is worse than the wasted time.

For file search, use the \`Glob\` tool (safely scoped, fast) or \`grep -r <pattern>
<known-dir>\` against a specific directory you already have reason to believe holds the
answer. If you don't know where something lives, check the table below before searching
blindly — most gsd-core paths are one of these:

| What | Path |
|---|---|
| CLI / tools shim | \`$GSD_HOME/gsd-core/bin/\` (resolved by \`load_project_state\`'s \`GSD_TOOLS\` discovery) |
| Workflow docs | \`$GSD_HOME/gsd-core/workflows/\` |
| Reference docs (this file's \`@\`-includes) | \`$GSD_HOME/gsd-core/references/\` |
| Templates | \`$GSD_HOME/gsd-core/templates/\` |

If a doc pointer elsewhere in this file (or in \`gsd-tools\` output) names a path outside
this table — e.g. anything under \`sdk/src/...\` — treat it as upstream-source-only. That
tree ships in the \`open-gsd/gsd-core\` git repo, not in your local install; don't search
the local filesystem for it, and don't assume its absence means something is broken.
</filesystem_search_discipline>`;

const BACKGROUND_TASK_HYGIENE_BLOCK = `<background_task_hygiene>
The Bash tool auto-backgrounds a call that runs long (e.g. an unrooted \`find\`, a hanging
server, a slow build) instead of blocking indefinitely. If you decide not to wait for or
use that call's result — you found the answer another way, or you abandoned that
approach — call \`TaskStop\` on it **immediately, before moving to the next step.** Do not
just move on and leave it running: an abandoned background process can wake up and emit a
delayed notification long after you've finished the plan, with no user around to act on
it.

Rule of thumb: every backgrounded Bash call you don't explicitly wait on and use gets
either consumed or stopped before you continue. Never both-neither.
</background_task_hygiene>`;

const EXECUTOR_STABILITY_RERUN_BLOCK = `**STABILITY-CONFIRMATION RERUN LIMIT:**
This is a separate cap from the one above — it bounds *reconfirming a step that already
passed*, not fixing one that failed. Once a verification/e2e/test step has passed
cleanly:
- Standard steps: do not re-run it again "to be sure." One clean pass is the result.
- Steps the plan's \`<threat_model>\` marks safety-critical, or whose success criteria call
  out flakiness/concurrency risk explicitly: at most one extra confirmation rerun (2 total
  runs) is allowed *if the reason is stated inline* (e.g. "rerunning: race-condition fix,
  single pass isn't sufficient evidence"). Never more than 2 total without a checkpoint.
- Re-running a green test with no new signal to act on is not verification — it's
  inertia. Document any extra confirmation run and its reason in SUMMARY.md next to the
  task it covers.`;

const DEBUGGER_STABILITY_RERUN_BLOCK = `**STABILITY-CONFIRMATION RERUN LIMIT:** The repeated runs above are an investigation technique for surfacing intermittent bugs — the repetition itself is the evidence. Once a stability/regression batch has produced a clean result (e.g., N/N passing, recorded in Evidence), stop. Do not launch another full batch of the same run "to be extra sure" with no new hypothesis or code change since the last batch. One additional batch is acceptable only if the original run count was thin (<20) or the bug is timing/concurrency-sensitive enough that the reasoning_checkpoint's \`blind_spots\` field names a specific reason more evidence is needed — document that reason in Evidence. Beyond that, a green stability run repeated again is not verification, it's inertia.`;

for this task should already have \`node_modules\` and any built cross-package output (e.g.
\`packages/*/dist\`) copied in via \`robocopy <src> <dst> /MIR\` before you were spawned. Only
install for packages genuinely new or changed relative to that copied base, and only after
confirming the copy didn't already cover them (\`ls node_modules/<pkg>\` / check
\`package.json\`'s lockfile hash against the base). Every worktree in a wave independently
reinstalling/rebuilding an unchanged shared dependency — instead of relying on what the
orchestrator already provisioned — is a common root cause of a wave taking hours instead of
minutes, and on Windows can outright fail with \`EPERM ... rename ..._tmp_N\` when two
worktrees resolve the same package against the shared pnpm store concurrently.

If running inside a worktree (\`.git\` is a file — see \`<worktree_metadata_capture>\`), do NOT
run \`pnpm install\`/\`npm install\`/\`yarn install\` (or anything triggering a fresh dependency
resolution) as your first move when a build or test step needs \`node_modules\`. First check
whether the orchestrator already provisioned it from the base checkout — a worktree created
for this task should already have \`node_modules\` present, either as a JUNCTION (the default —
check with \`(Get-Item node_modules).LinkType -eq 'Junction'\`) pointing at the base checkout's
real copy, or — only for a plan explicitly flagged to write into \`node_modules\` — a real,
isolated copy made via \`robocopy <src> <dst> /MIR /MT:32\`. If it's a junction, treat it as
READ-ONLY for your entire task, same as the base checkout itself: installing into it, or
deleting/recreating it, corrupts every other worktree in the wave still linked to it. Never
remove a junction with \`Remove-Item -Recurse\`/\`-Force\` — on Windows PowerShell that can FOLLOW
the reparse point and delete the base checkout's real \`node_modules\` instead of just the link;
if a junction genuinely needs replacing, remove it with \`cmd /c rmdir node_modules\` (no \`/s\`)
first, then recreate. Only install for packages genuinely new or changed relative to the
copied/linked base, and only after confirming they aren't already covered (\`ls
node_modules/<pkg>\` / check \`package.json\`'s lockfile hash against the base) — and only inside
a worktree holding its OWN real copy, never through a junction. Every worktree in a wave
independently reinstalling/rebuilding an unchanged shared dependency — instead of relying on
what the orchestrator already provisioned — is a common root cause of a wave taking hours
instead of minutes, and on Windows can outright fail with \`EPERM ... rename ..._tmp_N\` when two

</dependency_provisioning_order>`;

const EXECUTOR_DEPENDENCY_PROVISIONING_BLOCK = `<dependency_provisioning_order>
If running inside a worktree (\`.git\` is a file — see \`<worktree_metadata_capture>\`), do NOT
treat \`node_modules\` as pre-provisioned/read-only by default anymore — that was the old
junction-based setup. In a pnpm monorepo with \`enableGlobalVirtualStore: true\` set (see
\`rules-src/gsd.md\` "Parallel worktree waves" for why), your worktree owns a real, independent
\`node_modules\`; a plain \`pnpm install\` here is expected and fast (seconds, not minutes) once
the orchestrator has resolved dependencies on the base branch before dispatch — run it like
any single checkout. Skip it only when \`node_modules\` is already present and neither
\`package.json\` nor the lockfile changed for this task. If two worktrees install against the
shared store at the same moment you may see \`EPERM ... rename ..._tmp_N\` or a slow, serialized
install on Windows — that's contention with another worktree's install, not a real failure;
retry rather than debugging it as one. Never remove or force-clear \`node_modules\` with
\`Remove-Item -Recurse -Force\`/\`rm -rf\` on Windows — pnpm links packages via reparse points
internally, and both commands can follow one into a real target outside your worktree; this
has caused real data loss (see \`rules-src/gsd.md\`). If a plan instead hands you a pre-linked
JUNCTION or a real orchestrator-provisioned copy (older/non-pnpm setup), follow whatever the
dispatch instructions say for it — junction stays read-only, a flagged real copy is yours.
</dependency_provisioning_order>`;

const EXECUTOR_TEST_EXECUTION_DISCIPLINE_BLOCK = `<test_execution_discipline>
Scope every test invocation to this plan's own \`files_modified\` — the test runner's own
filter flag (\`--testPathPattern\`, \`--related\`, \`-k\`/\`-m\` marker selection) or, in a
Turborepo/pnpm-workspace monorepo, \`turbo test --filter=...[<base-ref>]\` /
\`pnpm --filter <affected-pkg> test\` — never the full suite as a matter of course. A worker
that finishes a small, scoped change but then runs the entire test suite has been observed
costing tens of minutes per worker, multiplied across every parallel worktree in a wave;
defer a full-suite run to end-of-phase verification or the CI gate, not to your own plan's
verification step.

When a full suite genuinely must run here (no narrower scope applies), chunk it into batches
of ~10 files/specs and run batches sequentially rather than the whole suite at once — this
narrows a hang to the specific batch instead of the whole run.
</test_execution_discipline>`;

const EXECUTOR_INCREMENTAL_PROGRESS_BLOCK = `**5b. Incremental progress signal:** The commit you just made in step 5 IS the incremental
progress artifact the orchestrator's liveness monitoring relies on — never batch multiple

distinguish "still working" from "stalled" without guessing.`;

You do not have the \`Agent\` tool (see your \`tools:\` frontmatter) — this is intentional, not
an oversight, and must not be worked around (e.g. by shelling out to a CLI that itself
dispatches Claude Code agents). Recursive/nested sub-agent spawning from a worker like you is
an active, unresolved source of uncontrolled exponential fan-out and token burn in current
Claude Code releases — the orchestrator, not you, owns deciding how work gets parallelized.
If a task seems to genuinely need further decomposition into parallel sub-work, that is an
architectural question — return a Rule 4 checkpoint instead of attempting it yourself.
</no_recursive_agent_spawn>`;

// Sibling of the executor block above, but for the ONE gsd-* worker that legitimately DOES have
// the `Agent` tool: gsd-debug-session-manager.md dispatches gsd-debugger at Step 2, so executor's
// "you do not have the Agent tool" wording would flatly contradict its own frontmatter - exactly
// the guardrail-vs-override contradiction that triggered refusals in the 2026-07 tests. This block
// states the bounded exception truthfully instead: Agent is granted for a single depth-capped use,
// and gsd-debugger (its only child) is a structural leaf with no Agent tool of its own, so the
// chain can't recurse past depth 2.
const DEBUG_SESSION_MANAGER_NO_RECURSIVE_AGENT_SPAWN_BLOCK = `<no_recursive_agent_spawn>
You DO have the \`Agent\` tool (see your \`tools:\` frontmatter) — this is a deliberate, reviewed
exception, granted for exactly ONE depth-capped use: dispatching the \`gsd-debugger\` investigator
(Step 2). \`gsd-debugger\` is a structural leaf — it has no \`Agent\` tool of its own and therefore
cannot spawn anything further — so the dispatch tree stays at depth 2 (you → debugger), the only
configuration proven safe in the 2026-07 recursive-delegation tests (see gsd.md "Depth boundary").

Hard limits, not negotiable:
- Dispatch ONLY \`subagent_type="gsd-debugger"\`. Never any other agent, never a coordinator or
  "fan-out" agent, never a freshly authored role that itself dispatches further work.
- Never run more than one debugger at a time; never recurse; never work around the depth cap by
  shelling out to a CLI that itself dispatches Claude Code agents.
- If work seems to genuinely need parallel decomposition beyond a single debugger, that is an
  architectural decision the orchestrator owns — surface it as a checkpoint, do not attempt it
  yourself.

blocks — after the first large file you read, every subsequent large \`Read\` gets zero
further reminder, silently. Don't rely on that one-time nudge as your ongoing signal: before
every \`Read\` on a file you expect to be large, ask whether you need the file's exact bytes
because you're about to \`Edit\` it, or whether you're reading it purely to understand/analyze
it. For the latter, use \`ctx_execute_file\` instead — every time, not just when reminded.

- The plan's \`<threat_model>\` STRIDE register assigns \`critical\` or \`high\` severity with a

- CONTEXT.md explicitly requests isolated verification for this task or its area (a

 * content with it replaced back to a plain, safe form - never re-introducing whatever problem
