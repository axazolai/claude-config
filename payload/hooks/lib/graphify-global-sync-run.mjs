// Shared worker: refresh THIS project's entry in the graphify cross-project global
// graph (~/.graphify/global-graph.json). Invoked from two places:
//   - hooks/graphify-global-sync.mjs (Claude Code PostToolUse) - fires after a
//     `git commit`, `git push`, or `git tag` Claude itself runs through the Bash tool.
//     Zero-setup, works from session one, but structurally can only see commands
//     Claude's Bash tool makes.
//   - <repo>/.git/hooks/post-commit (native git hook) - installed once per project
//     by session-init.mjs. Fires for EVERY commit git itself creates: manual/IDE
//     commits, `--amend`, rebases that call it, regardless of Claude Code being
//     involved at all. This is what actually covers "amends and user commits".
// Both callers may fire for the same commit - harmless, the PID/mtime lock below
// dedups so only one extraction actually runs.
// Hook trigger surface (2026-07-08): commit|push|tag, not just commit. `push` covers the
// "just pushed, nothing new committed this session" case commit-only missed. `tag` covers
// GSD phase/milestone close: when a GSD project has `git.create_tag: true` (the tier-2
// gsd-config-patch.mjs default), gsd-core tags on phase/milestone completion
// (`gsd/phase-{phase}-{slug}`, `gsd/{milestone}-{slug}`), so a tag is a reliable,
// git-visible "a phase just closed" signal without parsing gsd-core's own state.
// Deliberately NOT narrowed to only these three: this worker is a cheap, detached,
// lock-deduped background extraction - unlike GSD's own `/gsd-graphify build` (gsd.md §
// "graphify is two tools"), which is heavier and synchronous-ish, so narrowing to
// review/verify gates would matter there. There's no such cost here, so commit stays as a
// trigger too rather than being replaced by a narrower set.
// No Ultrapowers-close-specific trigger: Ultrapowers' review skills leave no git-visible
// signal of their own (no tag, no distinct command) - that case is covered incidentally by
// the commit/push triggers, since finishing an Ultrapowers branch always ends in one of those.
// Usage: node graphify-global-sync-run.mjs [repoPath]  (defaults to cwd)
// Never throws, never blocks: no-ops (exit 0) if this isn't a git repo, HEAD has no
// commits yet, or `graphify` isn't installed - this must never surface as an error
// to whichever caller ran it (a Claude Code hook or git itself).
