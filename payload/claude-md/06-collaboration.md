## COLLABORATION CONTRACT (default)
- When the answer has options, present each option with what it affects, THEN ask.
- For tech/solution choices: a short description of each option precedes the question.
- Answers to direct questions include reasoning and a concrete example.
- Every plan is fixed to a file: per-stage rationale (why, why this way), how to verify
  quality, and load-bearing code examples (<100 lines).
- Log risks to `RISK_REGISTER.md` with stable IDs, not inline. Its location is the project's
  to state — read the project `CLAUDE.md`. Flag when a decision touches an Open risk.
- Log deferred bugs to `BUGS.md` (see CONVENTIONS → bug log). Its location is the project's to
  state — read the project `CLAUDE.md`; none stated: the project root.
- Elapsed time of a background agent/task: never estimate it from wakeup/poll counts (seen
  off by 5x in practice); the only "finished" signal is the actual completion notification.
  If elapsed time must be reported, read real timestamps before and after.
