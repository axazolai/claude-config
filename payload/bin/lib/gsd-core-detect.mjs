// Both registration shapes, because gsd-core uses the one this bundle does not: every real
// gsd-core hook is a single quoted command line with no args array at all
// (`"…/node.exe" "…/hooks/gsd-check-update.js"`), while this bundle registers command+args.
// Matching args alone left every real registration behind after its file had been moved, so the
// hook fired and failed at every session. Unanchored and stopping at a quote or space, so it holds
// through quoting, either slash, and trailing arguments.
// `hooks/lib/gsd-*` stays unmatched: nothing registers a lib file as a hook, and a broader pattern
// would be a second place this code can reach outside its own files.
// A leading space counts as a boundary for the same reason `^` does: `node hooks/gsd-x.js` and a
// bare `hooks/gsd-x.js` are the same reference, and treating only one of them as one was an
// inconsistency, not a policy. `my-hooks/`, `xhooks/` and `.hooks/` still miss - `-`, `x` and `.`
// are not boundaries.
