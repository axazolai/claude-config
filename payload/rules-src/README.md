# rules-src

Source rules, compiled into a per-project snapshot — `<project>/.claude/stack-rules.md`.
These files are NOT auto-loaded by Claude Code. The directory is `rules-src`,
not `rules` — everything under `~/.claude/rules/` is loaded by Claude Code itself
(path-scoped via `paths:` frontmatter, unconditionally without it), and that mechanism has
no off switch. Delivery works by compilation instead:

- On session start, `hooks/session-init.mjs` only checks whether `.claude/stack-rules.md`
  exists; if not, it suggests running `/init-stack` (see "Building stack-rules" below - the
  command now owns generation). No automatic staleness/drift detection once a snapshot
  exists - re-run `/init-stack` or ask for a rebuild explicitly to refresh it. Simplified
  2026-07-13 from a `sourceHash`/`stackFingerprint` comparison (`hooks/lib/stack-rules-check.mjs`,
  which still runs - on an explicit `/init-stack`, and inside the compiler subagent to stamp the
  frontmatter - but compares the snapshot's recorded `markers` now, never the hashes)
  that fired a rebuild instruction every session on any drift. Opt out: `CLAUDE_STACK_RULES=0`.
- The snapshot enters context via an `@stack-rules.md` import line in the project's
  auto-loaded `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
- Design/rationale: `.ultrapowers/archive/specs/2026-07-12-stack-rules-design.md`.

## Rule layers (selection semantics)

- A **base** rule per language applies whenever that language is in the project's stack.
- A **direction** (framework) rule applies when its framework is detected; layers on the base.
- A **cross-cutting** rule (no language prefix) applies by concern, on top of language
  rules: `testing.md` and `security.md` always; `docker.md` / `ci.md` / `monorepo.md` /
  `api-contracts.md` / `mobile.md` when their signature files exist; `design-fidelity.md`
  when any UI stack is detected (react/next/react-native/flutter/wpf/ios/android);
  `gsd.md` when `.planning/` exists.
- `paths:` frontmatter in each rule is selection METADATA (which files the rule targets),
  kept for the compiler and for readers — Claude Code does not read it here.
- Rules are context, not enforcement. For hard gates (block an action every time) use a
  hook, not a rule.

## Naming convention

```
<lang>.base.md           # language base (broad glob)
<lang>.<direction>.md    # framework / direction (signature globs, layers on base)
<topic>.md               # cross-cutting, no language prefix (own signature globs)
```

## Building stack-rules (compiler instructions)

Run this as a subagent when `/init-stack` finds `.claude/stack-rules.md` missing, when a
session-start note flags it missing, or when the user asks for a rebuild:

1. **Detect stacks** from signature files (same marker set as `stack-rules-check.mjs` and
   the quick-fallback table in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`). Multiple stacks are normal — a
   full-stack monorepo includes each part's rules.
2. **Select rules** by the layer semantics above.
3. **Compile into one document, deduplicated.** State shared guidance once (e.g.
   `mobile.md` and `kotlin.android.md` overlap on permissions/secrets); keep all version
   pins; copy every rule's "Avoid:" list VERBATIM — dedup may merge prose but must never
   drop an Avoid item. Write for an AI reader: terse, no narration, no history.

   When more than the root carries markers, scope each rule section to the workspace it answers:
   a `## apps/web — next` heading, then that stack's rules. Rules shared by every workspace stay
   in one unscoped section at the top. A monorepo that states its frontend rules once, unscoped,
   applies them to its backend too — which is how a Next rule ends up governing a Nest service.

   Write rules **only for what was actually detected**. A project with no Python marker never
   receives Python rules. State the absence in **one line** — `Not detected: <markers looked for>`
   — and stop there. Never enumerate the deliberately-absent layers.
4. **Rewrite location-sensitive lines**: imports resolve relative to `.claude/`, so
   `@AGENTS.md` (from `node.next.md`) becomes `@../AGENTS.md` in the snapshot.
5. **Write `<project>/.claude/stack-rules.md`** with this frontmatter (hash values come
   from the session note, or from `node ~/.claude/hooks/lib/stack-rules-check.mjs <root>`):

```yaml
---
generated: stack-rules compiler   # machine-owned; edit rules-src and rebuild, not this file
sourceHash: <16-hex>
stackFingerprint: <16-hex>
stacks: {".": ["node"], "apps/web": ["next"], "apps/api": ["nest"]}
markers: {".": ["node","pnpm-ws"], "apps/web": ["next","node"], "apps/api": ["nest","node"]}
generatedAt: <ISO timestamp>
---
```

`stacks:` and `markers:` are written as YAML flow mappings, which are also valid JSON — each
one entirely on a SINGLE line. The desync check finds `markers:` with a line-anchored regex and
then `JSON.parse`s it, so the frontmatter can be a nested map without a YAML parser in a hook
that must stay cheap. The price of that cheapness: a `markers:` broken across several lines
matches nothing, and the snapshot reads back `legacy` forever — complete-looking, uncomparable.

`markers:` is not a duplicate of `stackFingerprint`. The hash says *that* the stack changed;
the map is what lets the next design session say *what* changed — `next appeared in apps/web`,
`vite vanished from the root`. A hash alone cannot name either, and naming it is the whole
value of the check.

Take both values from `node ~/.claude/hooks/lib/stack-rules-check.mjs <root>`, which now
reports `markers` per workspace. Never hand-write them — and do not stamp the indented
`"markers": {` block out of its JSON report either; that report is formatted for reading. The
check prints the stampable form last, on its own line, under `# stamp this line verbatim` — copy
those bytes. `stacks:` has no printed form (it is this compiler's rule selection, not detection
output), so re-serialise it to a single line yourself.

6. **Detected commands (rebuild-safe):** run `node ~/.claude/bin/detect-stack-commands.mjs --root <projectRoot>`
   and include its `## Detected commands` block verbatim as a section of the snapshot. It derives
   exact test/build commands from the same stack markers this snapshot fingerprints, so every
   rebuild reproduces it. Do not hand-edit the block — change the stack or the lookup instead.
7. **Ensure `<project>/.claude/CLAUDE.md` exists** and contains a line `@stack-rules.md`.
   Write the snapshot BEFORE adding the import — a dangling import target triggers an
   approval dialog.
8. **Root `CLAUDE.md`**: only when it exists AND is not `CURATED:NOEDIT`-marked, ensure a
   one-line pointer to `.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Never create a root `CLAUDE.md`; never edit a
   curated one (the deny hook blocks it anyway).
9. **Gitignore**: in a git repo, ensure `.claude/stack-rules.md` is listed in `.gitignore`
   (machine-generated personal config, not for the project's repo).
10. **Apply `templates/`** (see below).
11. **Updating an existing snapshot after drift.** When `stack-rules-check.mjs` reports
    `stale`, do NOT regenerate the snapshot from scratch. Add the `rules-src/` layers that
    answer each `added` marker, remove the sections belonging to each `removed` marker, and
    restamp `stackFingerprint` and `markers`. A full rebuild discards any hand-tuning in the
    snapshot and produces an unreviewable diff. A `legacy` status means the snapshot
    predates the `markers:` line: rebuild it once, fully, and it becomes comparable from then on.
    Re-running the check afterwards proves only that the frontmatter parses: it compares `markers`
    and never reads the body, so a rule section dropped by accident still reports `ok`. Check the
    surviving `## ` sections yourself.

## Adding a rule

1. Create `<lang>.<x>.md` for a language/framework direction, or `<topic>.md` for a
   cross-cutting concern — give it `paths:` frontmatter (selection metadata).
2. Keep it tight (~40 lines): concrete "use X / avoid Y", with versions where known.
3. State what to AVOID as well as what to use — contradictory rules are worse than none.
4. No extra deploy step beyond `setup.mjs`: the source hash changes, so every project
   rebuilds its snapshot on its next session start.
5. Cross-references to files outside `.claude/` (e.g. `payload/references/*.md`, which
   deploys to `~/.claude/references/`) must use the full `~/.claude/...` path, never a bare
   relative one like `references/foo.md`. The compiled snapshot lands in some other
   project's `.claude/`, not in `~/.claude/rules-src/`, so a relative path that only
   resolves from the source tree breaks for every reader once compiled.

## templates/

Project-root scaffold files, applied during the build (step 10) — not rules, never compiled
into the snapshot:

- `next.AGENTS.md` -> copy to the project root as `AGENTS.md` when the Next stack is
  detected and no `AGENTS.md` exists (Next.js breaking-changes-vs-training-data note; the
  snapshot's `node.next.md` section imports it via `@../AGENTS.md`).

## Ambiguous stacks

React / Next / Nest all use `.ts`; detection relies on signature files (`nest-cli.json`,
`next.config.*`, `vite.config.*`, ...). If detection picks wrong for a repo, state the
stack explicitly in that project's `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (e.g. "stack: NestJS backend") and
rebuild — the compiler must honor an explicit statement over inference.
