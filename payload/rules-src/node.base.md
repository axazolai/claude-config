# Node / TypeScript (base)
- Runtime: Node 24 LTS (Active LTS; Node 22 is Maintenance-only as of late 2025).
  Package manager: pnpm (not npm/yarn unless the repo says so).
- TypeScript strict mode on. No `any` in public signatures; prefer `unknown` + narrowing.
- ESM only (`"type": "module"`). Use `import`, not `require`.
- Lint/format: ESLint + Prettier. Before commit: `pnpm lint` plus the tests covering the change
  (`vitest related <files>` / `jest --findRelatedTests <files>`); the full `pnpm test` at review
  and immediately before `git push`.
- Errors: throw `Error` subclasses, never strings. No silent catches.
- Async: `async/await`, not raw `.then` chains. Always handle rejections.
- Validate at boundaries (zod or equivalent) — never trust external input.
- `null` does not reach a guard written for `undefined`. `= {}` as a default parameter
  substitutes for `undefined` only, so destructuring a bare `null` still throws; `JSON.parse`
  returns `null` for the input `"null"` without throwing, so a `try` around the parse does not
  protect the next property read. Where a value crosses a boundary — parsed JSON, a hook
  payload on stdin, an optional options object — guard it explicitly, `(v && typeof v ===
  "object") ? v : {}`, and place the guard before the first property access. That guard stops
  the throw; it does not reject an array, which is usually fine and always worth knowing.
- Avoid: default exports for shared modules, barrel files that hide cycles,
  scattered `process.env` reads (centralize config).
