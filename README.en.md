# Curated ~/.claude config — installation and how it works

[🇷🇺 Русский](README.md) | 🇬🇧 English

Cross-platform (Linux / macOS / Windows). Principle: **unpack the archive anywhere and run
one script** — the installer does all the copying into `~/.claude` itself, nothing to lay out
by hand.

```
node setup.mjs
```

After installing — **restart Claude Code** (hooks and settings are only read at startup).

## Install on a new machine (bootstrap, no manual download)

One command — it downloads the package as a tarball itself (no git needed) and runs
`setup.mjs`. Only **Node** is required (plus `tar`/`curl`, which ship out of the box on
Win10 1803+/macOS/Linux).

```
# Linux / macOS
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axazolai/claude-config/master/bootstrap.sh | bash

# Windows PowerShell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axazolai/claude-config/master/bootstrap.ps1 | iex
```

Forwarding flags to `setup.mjs` (e.g. a non-interactive replace): POSIX — `… | bash -s -- --replace-all`;
Windows — `$env:CLAUDE_SETUP_ARGS='--replace-all'; irm … | iex`.

**Windows: bootstrap + gsd agent patches in one go.** `setup.mjs` deliberately does NOT apply
the review-gated gsd-agent content patches (see "gsd-core") — after an install/update they are
normally applied separately (`/init-session` — init-stack.md no longer has this step). A ready PowerShell
block that does both at once (honours a `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` relocation; on a fresh machine
without gsd-core the third step is a harmless no-op):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axazolai/claude-config/master/bootstrap.ps1 | iex
$cc = $env:CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR; if (-not $cc) { $cc = Join-Path $HOME '.claude' }
node (Join-Path $cc 'apply-gsd-agent-patches.mjs')
```

> Note: with `curl|bash` on Linux/macOS, `setup.mjs` runs non-interactively (stdin is occupied
> by the pipe) — on an already-configured `~/.claude`, conflicts are resolved with an additive
> merge (no loss, with backups/sidecars); to force a replace, add `-- --replace-all`. On a clean
> machine there's no difference.

**Safer alternative** to `curl|bash` / `irm|iex` (read first, then run):

```
# Linux / macOS
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axazolai/claude-config/master/bootstrap.sh
less bootstrap.sh && bash bootstrap.sh

# Windows PowerShell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axazolai/claude-config/master/bootstrap.ps1 -OutFile bootstrap.ps1
notepad bootstrap.ps1; .\bootstrap.ps1
```

After installing — **restart Claude Code**.

---

## Order of operations

Two independent mechanisms with different scope — **they don't call each other and know
nothing about each other** (see "Repo layout" below): `setup.mjs` installs **`~/.claude` as a
whole** (hooks, rules, skills, `CLAUDE.md`, the base `settings.json` — once per machine),
`/init-stack` wires up **a specific project's plugins** (once per project, or when the stack
changes).

### Initial setup (new machine)

1. `node setup.mjs` (or bootstrap — see above) — installs `~/.claude`, including
   `~/.claude/bin/init-stack.mjs`, which step 3 uses.
2. **Restart Claude Code** (hooks and `settings.json` are only read at startup).
3. In every PROJECT that needs stack-specific plugins — open a Claude Code session there and
   run `/init-stack`. Its seven steps:
   - **1. detect** — runs `node ~/.claude/bin/init-stack.mjs` itself (stack detection + report,
     writes nothing); the file/dep marker → stack-id mapping and `STACK_PATHS` live in one
     shared source, `~/.claude/bin/lib/stack-markers.mjs` (replaces the old `stack-markers`
     skill). The same run re-migrates a GSD project's `.planning/config.json` `model_overrides`
     to the current model defaults (surgical, a no-op without `.planning/`);
   - **2. stack-rules snapshot** — `hooks/lib/stack-rules-check.mjs`, and on
     `stale`/`missing`/`legacy` a subagent rebuilds `.claude/stack-rules.md` (see "Stack rules"
     below);
   - **3. interactive install** — asks you to run `node ~/.claude/bin/init-stack.mjs -i`
     yourself, in YOUR OWN terminal: the interactive checklist (arrow-key UI) can't be driven
     through Claude; on confirmation it installs the missing plugins (`claude plugin install`),
     writes `./.claude/settings.json`, and then offers `npx skills add` for the skills the stack
     declares;
   - **4. fallback** — with no real terminal, the non-interactive path (`--enable`/
     `--apply-all`): activation only, no installs;
   - **5. design stack** — frontend stacks only: `bin/install-design-stack.mjs --root .`
     (Impeccable + the grafted Pro Max subset, see "Additional subsystems" below);
   - **6. finish** — the reminder to restart Claude Code;
   - **7. mark completion** — `hooks/lib/mark-initstack-done.mjs` (this is what lets the
     project's leanmode dial default to `full`) plus a best-effort graphify freshness check
     (`bin/graphify-freshness.mjs`, which only prints the upgrade command, never runs it).

   The GSD-specific proposals the pre-rewrite command carried are gone from here for good:
   `fallow` now reaches every profile through the plugin instead (delta `001-fallow-graft` in
   the ultrapowers fork), and `claude_orchestration` was deliberately retired — see
   RISK-INITSTACK-001, closed 2026-07-27.
4. **Restart Claude Code again** — `enabledPlugins` also only resolves at startup.

Bottom line for a new machine: `setup.mjs` — once, `/init-stack` — per project (right after
cloning the repo, or whenever it first needs plugins).

> Step 3 and the whole "Reconfiguring" table below describe the **full**-variant `/init-stack`
> (the Node script + plugin machinery). In the **lite** variant, `/init-stack` is not the same
> thing: it only detects the stack and assembles `.claude/stack-rules.md`, with no
> plugin install/enable step at all. Details and how to pick/switch the variant — "Bundle
> variants" below.

### Reconfiguring

| What changed | What to run | How often |
|---|---|---|
| A new version of this repo shipped (hooks/rules/skills updated) | `node setup.mjs` (conflict flags — see above; `--dry-run` to preview without touching anything) | whenever the package updates |
| `PreToolUse hook error` / broken paths in `~/.claude/settings.json` | `node setup.mjs --doctor`, then `node setup.mjs` | by symptom (see diagnostics below) |
| The project's stack changed/gained a new one (new framework, monorepo, etc.) | `/init-stack` again — already-enabled plugins are pre-checked + the new stack's auto-set is added | on a stack change |
| Toggle one specific plugin without a full `/init-stack` run | `node ~/.claude/bin/init-stack.mjs -i` directly (same checklist, but without the report, the stack-rules build, the design stack, or the completion mark) | as needed |
| Just check current plugin status, changing nothing | `node ~/.claude/bin/init-stack.mjs` (no args, writes nothing) | as needed |

After ANY of these steps that touched `settings.json` (user-level or project-level) —
**restart Claude Code**: hooks, the user `CLAUDE.md`, and `enabledPlugins` only resolve at
startup, there's no hot-reload.

---

## Bundle variants (full/base/lite)

The bundle installs in one of three profiles. The choice isn't tied to the first install —
switch at any time by re-running `setup.mjs`. The profiles live in `variants.json` (`lite`
inherits `base` through `extends`; `exclude` wins over `include`).

- **full** (default) — everything this README describes: every hook, every command, every
  skill. Plugins: `ultrapowers`, `context-mode`.
- **base** — full minus the GSD machinery: no `agents/gsd-*.md`, no
  `apply-gsd-agent-patches.mjs`, `gsd-defaults-sync.mjs` or `sync-gsd-context-mode-tool.mjs`,
  no `/init-session`, none of `hooks/gsd-*` or `hooks/lib/gsd-*`, no `rules-src/gsd.md`, no
  `references/`, no `using-git-worktrees` shadow skill, and no `db-live-access-gate`,
  `ci-watch-nudge` or `worktree-executor-discipline-advisor`. Same plugins as full.
- **lite** — base minus everything that needs heavy machinery:
  - exactly one plugin, `context-mode`. `ultrapowers` **ships to disk but is not enabled**
    (`variants.json → keepInstalled`), so bringing it back is one command rather than a
    reinstall from the marketplace;
  - exactly 10 hooks: `secrets-gate`, `deny-curated-claude-md`, `protected-guard`,
    `decision-records-nudge`, `graphify-global-sync`, `graphify-grep-nudge`, `inject-axes`,
    `precompact-observe`, `token-usage-log`, `session-init` (the last one still runs, but skips
    every GSD-specific step — see the callout in "Project auto-init" below);
  - `graphify`; `leanmode`; three "lazy" skills
    (`model-selection-policy`, `token-usage`, `update-changelog`);
  - its own `/init-stack` — stack detection + assembling `.claude/stack-rules.md` only, no
    Python/plugin machinery (see the callout in "Initial setup" above);
  - its own `rules-src/README.md` (no GSD specifics) and its own `model-selection-policy`, both
    from the `payload-lite/` overlay layered on top of `payload/`. `CLAUDE.md` is NOT overlaid:
    it is assembled fragment by fragment from `payload/claude-md/*.md` per profile
    (`bin/lib/assemble-claude-md.mjs`, each fragment's `profiles:` frontmatter);
  - **NOT included**, on top of what base already drops: the `schedulewakeup` nudge, the
    pnpm-phantom guard, bg-supervision (`supervise-bg.mjs`), the Turbopack check, and the
    `/init-mcp` and `/pnpm-phantom-fix` commands.

No profile ships (`variants.json → alwaysExclude`): `hooks/task-lifecycle-probe*` (the
`TaskCreated`/`TaskCompleted` schema probe — kept in the repo as a stub, never installed and
never registered), `claude-md/**` (fragments are input to the `CLAUDE.md` build, not files for
`~/.claude`), and `**.test.mjs`.

### `ultrapowers` replaces `superpowers`

`full` and `base` use **`ultrapowers@ultrapowers`** as the base skills plugin (in `lite` it
ships to disk but stays disabled) — our fork of
[`obra/superpowers`](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) (Jesse Vincent, MIT), narrowed to Claude
Code. It lives in [`axazolai/ultrapowers`](https://github.com/axazolai/ultrapowers): branch
`original` holds pristine upstream snapshots, `patch` holds the plugin map, the rename transform
and our deltas, and `main` is the generated result. `main` is never hand-edited — a rebuild that
does not reproduce it byte-for-byte is a defect the build reports.

Only what is actually the plugin is carried across (51 of upstream's 180 files: the manifest, the
`SessionStart` hook, the skills, `LICENSE`). Everything else — the six other harnesses, upstream's
own test suite, their docs and release tooling — is recorded as **deliberately ignored**, with a
reason on every rule. A file that appears upstream and lands in neither list blocks the build until
a human classifies it.

**Upstream is disabled, not uninstalled** (`variants.json → keepInstalled`): rollback is one
command — re-enable `superpowers`, disable the fork — rather than a reinstall from the marketplace.
Running both enabled is not the fallback: they share 14 skill names.

**Plugin consent is per action.** `setup.mjs` prints the plan and asks `y` (all) / `n` (none) /
`s` (choose). Under `s` each action is asked separately and labelled with what it does:
`enable`/`disable` touch only `settings.json`, `install`/`uninstall` touch files, and
`marketplace_add` fetches and trusts remote code. Declining a marketplace also drops the installs
that need it — they would fail at the CLI — and the reason is printed.

Updating is `/up-update`: `check` is read-only and runs from any project; `update` rebuilds in a
throwaway clone and either refuses with the condition that fired, or prepares the release and
stops. Publishing needs an explicit `--publish`, and getting the new version onto a machine is a
separate `/plugin update`.

### Selecting a variant

- Interactively: `node setup.mjs` asks `bundle profile [full/base/lite] (Enter = …)` — the default
  (Enter) comes from whatever is already installed per
  `~/.claude/state/bundle-manifest.json`'s `variant` field, or `full` on a fresh machine.
- With a flag: `node setup.mjs --variant=lite` (or `--variant=full`) — skips the question.
- No terminal and no flag (CI, non-TTY): keeps whatever variant is already installed, else
  `full`.
- Via bootstrap: POSIX — `curl ... | bash -s -- --variant=lite`; Windows —
  `$env:CLAUDE_SETUP_ARGS='--variant=lite'; irm ... | iex` — the same flag-forwarding mechanism
  as `--replace-all` (see "Install on a new machine" above). The bootstrap scripts themselves
  weren't changed for variants — the flag just rides through to `setup.mjs` as usual.

### Switching variants

Reinstall: `node setup.mjs` (interactively pick the other variant, or pass
`--variant=full`/`--variant=lite` directly). The installer:

- finds files that aren't part of the new variant but are still on disk (surplus after the
  switch), prints the list, and asks for confirmation before deleting (`y/N`) — the same prune
  mechanism that cleans up stale bundle files in general (see "How the installer works" above).
  **Curated files and files you've edited by hand** (on-disk hash doesn't match what the last
  `setup.mjs` run recorded) are never pruned — they're left as-is even if the new variant
  doesn't include them.
- filters the hook entries in `settings.json` for the new variant: switching to base/lite drops
  the GSD hooks, switching back restores them. The `statusLine` key no longer varies by profile —
  the same `statusline.mjs` is registered on full/base/lite (see "What each hook does and why"
  below), so switching variants leaves it alone; your own, non-bundle `statusLine` is still left
  alone too.
- reconciles the plugin set and prints a plan (what to install/remove, what to enable/disable)
  — asks for confirmation (`y/N`) before calling `claude plugin install/uninstall`; if the
  `claude` CLI isn't on PATH, it prints the commands for you to run by hand instead of
  executing them.
- **requires restarting Claude Code** — as always, `enabledPlugins`, hooks, and `statusLine`
  don't hot-reload.

The `~/.claude/state/bundle-manifest.json` manifest stores a `variant` field — it decides the
default offered on the next flag-less run, and `session-init.mjs` uses the same field to decide
which GSD-specific steps to skip (a manifest with no `variant` field is a pre-variant bundle,
treated as `full`).

For tests there's a hermetic mode: `CLAUDE_SETUP_SKIP_PLUGINS=1` skips the plugin-reconciliation
step entirely (including the `claude plugin list` probe), without touching the CLI.

---

## Relocating `~/.claude` to another drive

`setup.mjs` and every runtime script/hook read the config directory as
`process.env.CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR || ~/.claude`, so the set can be installed into a relocated
directory **with no code changes**. Two ways (not mutually exclusive):

- **Symlink** `~/.claude` → the target folder (`mklink /D`, needs admin / Developer Mode once).
  Works at the filesystem level → covers **everything**: the CLI, the VS Code extension, any tool
  that hardcodes `~/.claude`. The more universal option.
- **`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`** (`setx CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR "D:\claude-home"`, no admin). An official but
  **undocumented, CLI-only** variable: **the VS Code extension ignores it**, and plugin
  relocation isn't guaranteed (the registry stores absolute paths → a reinstall is possible). It
  must be persistent and present when Claude Code starts.

At startup `setup.mjs` interactively offers to set/change `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (defaulting to an
existing symlink's target); **Enter = don't set it**. The entered path is validated (slash
normalization; relative paths, bad syntax, network/removable/CD drives, a nonexistent drive, or a
symlink in the path are rejected) — on an error it re-asks. Setting the variable does **not**
remove the symlink — it stays as a fallback.

> Every `.mjs` uses a symlink-safe entry-point guard: under a symlinked `~/.claude`, Node
> realpaths `import.meta.url` but not `argv[1]`, so a naive guard would silently not run `main()`
> (the hook/script is "dead"). The guard checks the raw **or** realpath'd `argv[1]`.

---

## Additional subsystems (bin/commands/hooks)

Beyond the baseline protection, the set installs a few independent tools (each with its own unit
tests `*.test.mjs`, run via `node --test`):

- **pnpm phantom-dependency guard** — the `/pnpm-phantom-fix` command + `bin/pnpm-phantom-scan.mjs`
  + the PostToolUse hook `hooks/pnpm-phantom-fix-hook.mjs`: finds undeclared-but-imported packages
  (e.g. `@hookform/resolvers`→`zod`) and additively declares them as optional peers in
  `packageExtensions`, so `enableGlobalVirtualStore` doesn't break them. The per-project wiring is
  installed by `bin/pnpm-phantom-fix-install.mjs` (pnpm only, idempotent, no removal path);
  the root `postinstall` is cross-shell — node resolves `$HOME` itself, so it works under cmd.exe
  (where `~` isn't expanded) and POSIX alike, and is a silent no-op on a machine without claude-config.
- **Turbopack × global-virtual-store** — `bin/turbopack-gvs-check.mjs` (`/init-stack`, Next+pnpm
  only): detects the structural conflict of an out-of-tree store with Turbopack (chunks `404`
  after a hard reload) and prints a recipe. The recipe is version-aware and monorepo-aware: for
  pnpm ≥11 it writes `virtualStoreDir` to `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (camelCase), for <11 to `.npmrc`
  (kebab); the store is anchored on the workspace root (and, for a git worktree, on the canonical
  main worktree so every worktree of one repo shares one `<repo>-store`), and `turbopack.root` is
  widened to the correct depth for a nested app. Read-only, changes nothing.
- **Background-task supervision** — `bin/supervise-bg.mjs` wraps a background command in a
  timeout + staleness watchdog (a hang → an exit event, not a silent stall) + the PreToolUse nudge
  `bg-supervision-nudge` + PostToolUse `ci-watch-nudge` (after `git push` — `gh run watch`) + the
  PreToolUse nudge `schedulewakeup-loop-only-nudge` (ScheduleWakeup is for /loop pacing only; a
  tracked background task's completion re-invokes the model by itself, so polling wakeups are
  pure waste).
- **A frontend project's design stack** — `bin/install-design-stack.mjs` (step 5 of
  `/init-stack`, only when detection found a frontend stack). It installs **Impeccable**
  per project (`npx impeccable install --providers=claude --scope=project --no-hooks`) and grafts
  the search subset of **UI/UX Pro Max** onto it (`uipro init --ai claude --offline`, keeping
  `ui-ux-pro-max`, `ui-styling` and `design-system` and deleting the rest of its skill folders).
  What gets installed is declared by the `designStack` block in
  `setting-templates/frontend/_base.json` — not plugin machinery, and never merged into
  `settings.json`. Idempotent and fail-soft: a re-run installs only what is missing and
  re-verifies the hook and the graft. Both halves are in the component registry, so they update
  themselves (see "Auto-updating components" below).
- **Cleaning up `~/.claude`** — the `/claude-cleanup` command + `bin/claude-cleanup.mjs`. The
  engine is allowlist-based: it only ever proposes paths under enumerated category roots
  (`ephemeral` — caches, logs and shell snapshots 7 days or older; `age` —
  `file-history`/`jobs`/`tasks`/backups older than 14 days; `session` — old project transcripts;
  stale temp dirs and superseded plugin-cache versions), so `memory/`, live config, venvs and
  the running session are out of scope by construction. A dry-run report comes first, then an
  explicit confirmation; nothing is deleted — everything moves into
  `~/.claude/.cleanup-trash/<batch>/` and stays restorable for 7 days.

Permissions in `settings.partial.json` are normalized on merge: `Write(x)`/`MultiEdit(x)` →
`Edit(x)` (+ dedup), since Claude Code now matches all file tools via `Edit(path)`, and
`MultiEdit` is no longer a tool.

---

## Why any of this (problem → solution)

The underlying problem: in Claude Code, **a project `CLAUDE.md` overrides the user one**, and
`CLAUDE.md` itself loads as context, not as "hard" config — meaning any project file
(including a GSD-generated one) can silently override your carefully-tuned rules. Prose in the
global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` can't protect against that. Only hooks work reliably.

So this package does three things:

1. **Protects curated files** — a PreToolUse hook blocks edits to any `CLAUDE.md` carrying the
   `<!-- CURATED:NOEDIT -->` marker, wherever it lives (project root or `.planning/`). The
   marker decides everything, the path doesn't matter. Unmarked (generated) files are edited
   freely.
2. **Catches secrets** — a PreToolUse hook on `git commit` scans staged changes; on a hit, the
   commit is blocked (only fires on commits Claude makes, not your manual ones).
3. **Removes the busywork on new projects** — a SessionStart hook automatically marks a
   curated root `CLAUDE.md`, adds a per-project exclude for a GSD-owned `.planning/CLAUDE.md`,
   and appends a risk to `RISK_REGISTER.md`. Nothing to do by hand, per project.

---

## What goes where

What follows is the **full** profile (what `base` and `lite` drop from it — see "Bundle
variants" above). The `*.test.mjs` files next to each script stay in the repo and are not
installed.

## How the installer works (`setup.mjs`)

- Copies all files into `~/.claude` (creates folders), sets +x on `.mjs` under POSIX.
- **Scope — `~/.claude` only** (hooks, `rules-src/`, `skills/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `settings.json`).
  Project plugins are NOT part of this — that's a separate, independent mechanism,
  `/init-stack` (see below), with its own script (`bin/init-stack.mjs`) and its own output. If
  after running `setup.mjs` the output only shows plugin-related messages — `/init-stack` was
  probably run instead of `setup.mjs`: they don't call each other and know nothing about each
  other.

Two tiers of files, handled differently, **deliberately**:

- **Managed content** — `.mjs` scripts, and really any `.md`/text file that is NOT marked
  `CURATED:NOEDIT`. The package is the source of truth, so such a file **is always overwritten
  with the archive's version, no questions asked** — exactly like scripts. This is what makes
  "drop in a fresh package, old files get updated" real not just for `.mjs`, but for `rules-src/`,
  `skills/`, `README.md`, etc.
- **Curated content** — a file whose **current on-disk content** carries the `CURATED:NOEDIT`
  marker (in practice — your `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`). Never touched silently: a diff is shown,
  three options to choose from (see below). The marker decides, not the filename — same as in
  the `deny-curated-claude-md.mjs` hook's protection model.
- **JSON** (`settings.json`, `setting-templates/*.json`) — a third case: a real **additive deep
  merge** (your values are kept, missing keys/array items are added). Also conflict-checked
  like curated files, because JSON usually holds real per-machine values (marketplace ids, your
  model choice, etc.) that must never be silently overwritten.

### Conflicts (curated text and JSON): merge / replace / skip

A unified diff is shown (`@@ … @@` format, with line numbers and terminal highlighting) and
three options:

- **(m) merge** — the default.
  - **any `.json`** (your addition, `settings.json`, `setting-templates/*.json`) — deep
    additive merge, as described above. For `settings.json`, the source of "what we need" is
    `settings.partial.json` from the archive itself (not a second, separately-written list
    inside `setup.mjs` — that used to be the case, and it's exactly what caused drift: a hook
    added to `settings.partial.json` never made it into the actual `settings.json`, even though
    the `.mjs` file itself was copied correctly). Stale/duplicate entries for OUR hooks (by
    filename, not by event — a hook moving from `SessionStart` to `PreToolUse` is picked up
    too) are removed, current ones are added — re-running is idempotent.
  - curated `.md`/text — can't be merged automatically, and the diff shown above IS the merge
    output. Nothing is written — not to the file, not alongside it (no `<name>.new`): your file
    stays byte-for-byte as it was; apply the diff by hand, or re-run with `--replace-all`.
- **(r) replace** — the archive's version is written over your file. **No backup is made** —
  the diff shown above is the only record of what was there; recover via git/your own copy if
  you need it (for `.json` under merge — the merge result; under replace — the archive file
  as-is).
- **(s) skip** — the file is left untouched (for curated text, this is the same outcome as the
  default merge above: the file stays as-is).

If the file is new — it's simply **copied**. If an existing `.json` already contains
everything from the archive (a superset) — `unchanged`, nothing is written. Non-curated text
that differs from the archive — `updated`, no prompt.

**Important if you already have manual edits in non-curated `.md` files** (e.g. your own
`rules-src/node.react.md`): starting with this version they will be silently overwritten with the
archive's version on the next `setup.mjs` run (the same behavior `.mjs` has always had). If you
have such edits and need to keep them — either move them into the archive (this repo) before
running, or put the `<!-- CURATED:NOEDIT -->` marker as the first line of the file itself to
get the merge/replace/skip dialog instead of a silent overwrite. Run `--dry-run` first if
you're not sure exactly what will update.

At the end of the run — **`--- summary ---`** (a full file list tagged created/updated/
unchanged/merged/replaced/skipped) and **`--- by category ---`** (a per-folder digest: `hooks:
N updated, M unchanged`, `rules-src: ...`, etc.) — so you don't have to guess whether rules and
hooks updated by scanning a long path list.

### Diff readability

- In a terminal, the diff is colored (green "+", red "−", cyan `@@` headers) and has line
  numbers.
- `--no-color` or the `NO_COLOR` variable — turn off color.
- `--md` — print the diff as a markdown ```diff block (handy to redirect into a file/PR — it
  gets colorized there automatically).

### Repo layout: `payload/` vs root

The repo is split into two zones:

- **`payload/`** — everything that actually gets installed into `~/.claude` (`hooks/`,
  `skills/`, `rules-src/`, `commands/`, `setting-templates/`, `bin/`, `add-risk.mjs`,
  `graphify-sync-all.mjs`, `CLAUDE.md`). The installer **mirrors the whole `payload/` tree**
  into `~/.claude`, preserving structure relative to `payload/` (i.e. `payload/hooks/foo.mjs`
  → `~/.claude/hooks/foo.mjs`).
- **Repo root** — the installer's own meta, never copied: `setup.mjs`,
  `bootstrap.sh`/`bootstrap.ps1`, `README.md`, `settings.partial.json`,
  `gsd-defaults.partial.json`, `RISK_REGISTER.snippet.md`, this repo's own register
  `.ultrapowers/RISK_REGISTER.md` (not to be confused with the installed `~/.claude/state/...`),
  `docs/` and `.ultrapowers/` (reference material, design specs/plans, planning history —
  outside distribution).

You can just drop your own files/folders into `payload/` — they'll be copied with structure
preserved (`payload/commands/`, `payload/agents/`, extra `payload/skills/`, any of your own
files). Same rules apply: none exists → created; an existing `.mjs` → silently overwritten with
the bundle's version; any other existing file → diff + choice. Under POSIX, +x is set on every
copied `.mjs`.

The `settings.json` file at the archive root (`~/.claude/settings.json`) isn't copied as a
plain file — it's managed by a separate additive merge based on `settings.partial.json` (see
below). Hidden files (`.git`, `.DS_Store`, etc.) inside `payload/` are also never copied.
Likewise, `gsd-defaults.partial.json` doesn't go through the normal diff/merge logic — it has its
own mirror+merge logic, see the subsection below.

### `gsd-defaults.partial.json` → `~/.gsd/defaults.json`

A curated set of personal GSD defaults (`model_profile`, `models`/`model_overrides`, `workflow`
toggles, etc.) is synced separately from `settings.json` and is **not conflict-checked** — no
diff, no dialog, because it's your own bundle, not someone else's config with per-machine values:
the merge is always additive and can't silently clobber anything.

- `setup.mjs` first copies `gsd-defaults.partial.json` as-is into `~/.claude` (a mirror copy —
  needed by the CLI below, which after install has no access to the repo root), then calls
  `syncGsdGlobalDefaults()` (`hooks/lib/gsd-defaults-sync.mjs`): a **deep additive merge** into
  `~/.gsd/defaults.json` (gsd-core's own machine-global default) — your existing values stay,
  missing ones are added. Silent, best-effort: a read/write error doesn't halt the install.
- A specific project's `.planning/config.json` is left untouched by `setup.mjs` — it's not tied to
  a project. For that there's a separate CLI **`~/.claude/gsd-defaults-sync.mjs`** (installed
  there — run manually (`/init-stack` no longer calls it):
  `node ~/.claude/gsd-defaults-sync.mjs [homeDir] [projectDir]`). In one pass it: repeats the same
  merge into `~/.gsd/defaults.json`; applies a **reference-wins merge** (`mergeReferenceWins`) into
  the current project's `.planning/config.json` — bundle values overwrite the project's same-named
  keys, other keys are left alone (skipped if there's no `.planning/` or `config.json` can't be
  read); and runs the same safe statusLine guard as `setup.mjs` (see above) via
  `ensureStatuslineOverride()` (`hooks/lib/gsd-statusline-registration.mjs`) — not a shared
  implementation with `setup.mjs`'s inline block but a second, independent one (the CLI has no
  interactive diff to fall back on, so the overwrite decision must be unconditionally safe on its
  own), both deliberately solving the same three-way problem. Both also still recognize the old
  `gsd-context-meter.mjs` command in an already-written `statusLine.command` — that file is
  deleted in this version, but the recognition is kept on purpose: a machine carrying that old
  registration is recognized as ours and migrates to `statusline.mjs`, rather than being treated
  as a custom `statusLine`.
  Handy to re-run in isolation after editing `gsd-defaults.partial.json`, without a full
  `setup.mjs`.

### Flags (non-interactive / for CI)

```
node setup.mjs --merge-all     # all conflicts -> merge
node setup.mjs --replace-all   # all conflicts -> replace (no backup)
node setup.mjs --skip-all      # all conflicts -> skip
node setup.mjs --dry-run       # show what would be done, without writing
node setup.mjs --md            # diffs as markdown ```diff
node setup.mjs --doctor        # check registered hook paths
node setup.mjs --uninstall-gsd # base/lite: move a foreign gsd-core to .cleanup-trash (reversible)
```

`--uninstall-gsd` deliberately does **not** follow from `--replace-all`/`--merge-all`: those flags
are about this bundle's own files, while gsd-core is a separate product, so removing it always
needs its own consent. Outside a terminal and without the flag the step only prints a report.
Nothing is deleted — everything moves into a dated `.cleanup-trash` batch (7-day rollback, the
commands are printed on the spot); `~/.gsd/` and every project's `.planning/` are never touched.

If run **not in a terminal** and with no flag, the default action for existing non-scripts is
**merge**: `.json` is genuinely merged, curated `.md`/text is left as-is (nothing is written,
the diff is already shown). `.mjs` are always updated. To skip/replace instead — the
`--skip-all` / `--replace-all` flags.

---

## Protection model: the marker, not the path

Authority "travels" with the marker. Any `CLAUDE.md` that CONTAINS a
`<!-- CURATED:NOEDIT -->` line (not necessarily the first one — a heading, frontmatter, etc.
may come before it; whitespace around the line and around `<!--`/`-->` doesn't matter) is
considered curated: protected from edits by the agent and is the source of truth — whether at
the root or in `.planning/`. Unmarked files (e.g. GSD-generated ones) are edited freely. There
is no binding to a specific path — and no binding to the line's position in the file either.
Just naming the marker in prose (like this sentence) doesn't count — only the whole line
itself matches.

---

## Project auto-init (SessionStart)

The `session-init.mjs` hook fires at the start of EVERY session (state lives in
`~/.claude/state/project-init.json`, but most steps below are NOT one-time — see why). It
**deterministically fixes files** (doesn't rely on context injection — that can be dropped on
fresh sessions sometimes). In the **lite** variant the GSD-specific items below (the risk
register, the `.planning/CLAUDE.md` exclude, the `/init-mcp` suggestion) are skipped entirely —
see "Bundle variants" above:

- **auto-marks** an unmarked root `CLAUDE.md` as curated — unless it looks GSD-generated.
  **Re-checked every session, idempotently** (used to be one-time on a project's first session
  — that turned out to be a bug: if the root `CLAUDE.md` didn't exist yet on the first session
  and appeared later, e.g. from `graphify claude install`, it stayed unmarked forever, because
  the one-time flag was already spent). Toggle: `CLAUDE_CURATED_AUTOMARK_ROOT=0`.
- **adds a per-project `claudeMdExcludes`** for an unmarked (GSD-owned) `.planning/CLAUDE.md`
  in that project's `.claude/settings.json` (this exclude is not set globally: a union-exclude
  can't be undone at the project level, and it would hide your curated
  `.planning/CLAUDE.md`). **Re-checked every session**, for the same reason as the item above.
- **appends the GSD risk** to an existing `RISK_REGISTER.md` (via `add-risk.mjs`: understands
  either table or section format, picks the next free ID, idempotently).
- **suggests `/init-mcp`** (a hint only — runs nothing): if the repo has a GitHub/GitLab remote
  or shows signs of DB usage (`postgres`/`DATABASE_URL`/`prisma`/`typeorm`/`psycopg`/
  `sqlalchemy` in configs) and the matching MCP isn't wired yet — appends a suggestion to
  `additionalContext` to wire it via `/init-mcp` (which also offers a self-hosted SearXNG
  option for web search). **Re-checked every session** (git/DB can appear later, so this isn't
  one-time) and stops on its own once the matching MCP is wired. Web search isn't detected
  passively (on-demand) — mentioned as an option. Toggle: `CLAUDE_MCP_SUGGEST=0`.
- **checks whether the stack-rules snapshot exists** (a hint only — touches no files): just
  checks `.claude/stack-rules.md` for existence. No staleness detection at session start -
  simplified 2026-07-13; it used to compare the snapshot's frontmatter against the current state
  of `~/.claude/rules-src/` and the project's stack (`hooks/lib/stack-rules-check.mjs`), removed
  as too eager (fired on every session with any drift). Drift itself is now caught in
  `/init-stack`, off the `markers` map rather than the hashes. When the file is missing, appends a
  suggestion to run `/init-stack` to `additionalContext` — generating the snapshot is now one
  of that command's own steps. Mechanism details — the "Stack rules (stack-rules)" section
  below. Toggle: `CLAUDE_STACK_RULES=0`.
- **prunes the global token-usage log** (`~/.claude/state/token-usage.jsonl`) — calls
  `pruneGlobalLogIfDue()` from `hooks/lib/token-usage-prune.mjs`. The function throttles itself
  to once/24h (its own state file), so an actual sweep doesn't happen every session. Moved here
  2026-07-13: it used to run from `token-usage-log.mjs` on `SubagentStop`/`Stop` — retention is
  a session-start concern, not a per-log-write one. Toggle: `CLAUDE_TOKEN_USAGE_PRUNE=0`
  (checked inside the function itself).

Toggles (environment variables the hook reads):

```
CLAUDE_CURATED_AUTOMARK_ROOT=0   # don't auto-mark the root (show a hint instead)
CLAUDE_CURATED_AUTOINIT=0        # disable auto-init entirely
CLAUDE_MCP_SUGGEST=0             # don't suggest /init-mcp on a git/DB signal
CLAUDE_STACK_RULES=0             # don't check for the stack-rules snapshot (see the section below)
CLAUDE_TOKEN_USAGE_PRUNE=0       # don't prune the global token-usage log
```

Reset a specific project's state (to re-run it) — delete its entry from
`~/.claude/state/project-init.json`.

## Stack rules (stack-rules): a snapshot instead of auto-loading

Language/framework rules live in `~/.claude/rules-src/` and are **not auto-loaded**. The
folder used to be `~/.claude/rules/` — but Claude Code loads everything inside that path
itself (path-scoped via `paths:` frontmatter, unconditionally without it), and that mechanism
has no off switch: `rules/README.md` + `rules/templates/*.md` were landing in EVERY session of
EVERY project (~7.3 KB of pure overhead). The only way to stop it is to move the files out of
the scanned path — hence the rename.

How rules reach a session now:

- **A per-project snapshot `<project>/.claude/stack-rules.md`** — a compiled digest of
  `rules-src/` scoped to the project's stack: the language's base rules + the framework's
  direction rules + cross-cutting ones (testing/security, etc.), with overlaps deduplicated;
  every "Avoid" list is carried over verbatim, version pins as-is. It's built by a subagent
  following `~/.claude/rules-src/README.md` § "Building stack-rules" — as a step of
  `/init-stack`, or by hand on request. The `paths:` frontmatter in the sources is kept — it's
  now selection metadata for the compiler; Claude Code doesn't read it.
- **Into context** the snapshot gets via an `@stack-rules.md` import line in the project's
  auto-loaded `.claude/CLAUDE.md`. The file itself is added to the project's `.gitignore` at
  build time — it's machine-generated personal config and doesn't belong in the project's repo.
- **A session-start check** — simplified 2026-07-13 to a plain `existsSync` on
  `.claude/stack-rules.md` (`session-init.mjs`), no more hash comparison. File missing → a
  suggestion to run `/init-stack` is appended to `additionalContext` — generating the snapshot
  is now one of its own steps. File present → the hook stays silent and does NOT re-check
  anything else: at session start the snapshot is never auto-flagged as stale, even if
  `rules-src/` or the project's stack changed. This used to be a `sourceHash`/`stackFingerprint`
  comparison — it compared hashes, and `sourceHash` is computed from path/size/mtime, so every
  `setup.mjs` deploy moved it without a single edit to any rule text: comparing on every session
  turned out too eager. Toggle: `CLAUDE_STACK_RULES=0`.
- **The drift check lives in `/init-stack`, and it names what changed.**
  `hooks/lib/stack-rules-check.mjs` compares no hashes — it compares the `markers` map the
  snapshot recorded in its frontmatter, for the root AND every workspace (in a pnpm monorepo
  `next.config.ts` sits in `apps/web/`, so root markers alone never see the frontend at all).
  It prints a `status` (`ok` / `stale` / `missing` / `legacy`) and the `{ workspace, marker }`
  pairs that appeared and vanished, which is what makes the rebuild a targeted edit rather than
  a regeneration. `sourceHash`/`stackFingerprint` are still stamped into the frontmatter but
  decide nothing. Snapshots built before the `markers:` line read `legacy`: reported, never
  counted as drift — flagging them would have every project on the machine report drift on first
  contact, which is exactly how this check got switched off last time. One full rebuild makes
  such a snapshot comparable from then on.
- **Templates** (`rules-src/templates/`) are no longer auto-loaded — they're applied during
  the snapshot build: `next.AGENTS.md` → `AGENTS.md` at the project root when a Next stack is
  detected and the file doesn't exist yet; `graphify.PROJECT.md` → the root `CLAUDE.md` when
  the project has a `graphify-out/` (if the root file is curated or missing, the suggestion is
  surfaced to you instead of writing).

**Migration on install**: `setup.mjs` cleans the old `~/.claude/rules/` — it removes the
files whose relative path exists in the bundle's `rules-src/` (old bundle-owned copies: leave
them in place and they'd keep auto-loading, doubling every rule), keeps your own files
untouched (printing a note — move them into `rules-src/` by hand if the auto-loading isn't
intended), and deletes the folder entirely once it's empty. Existing projects need no action:
the first session after the upgrade finds no snapshot and gets the build instruction.

**What's covered** (the compiler layers `base → direction → cross-cutting`; the full list and how
the layers resolve are in `rules-src/README.md`):

- **Languages/frameworks (direction):**
  - **Node** — `node.base` + `nest` / `next` / `react` / `react-native` / `telegram`
  - **Python** — `python.base` + `cli` / `data` / `django` / `fastapi` / `flask` / `telegram`
  - **C#** — `csharp.base` + `aspnet` / `cli` / `wpf`
  - **Kotlin** — `kotlin.base` + `android` / `intellij-plugin`
  - **Swift** — `swift.base` + `ios`
  - **Dart** — `dart.base` + `flutter`
- **Cross-cutting (mixed in per project signals):** `testing`, `security`, `api-contracts`,
  `ci`, `docker`, `sql`, `shell`, `mobile`, `monorepo`, `context7` (when the MCP server of that
  name is wired up), and for GSD projects (`.planning/`) — `gsd` (methodology routing +
  `CLAUDE.md` quarantine rules).
- **The "Detected commands" block** at the end of the snapshot — the test and build commands
  derived from the same markers: `bin/detect-stack-commands.mjs` prints ready markdown and the
  compiler includes it. A stack with no confident default says so plainly instead — an invented
  command is worse than a missing one.
- **Templates** (`rules-src/templates/`): `next.AGENTS.md`, `graphify.PROJECT.md` — see above.

Each file is self-documenting; this is only a coverage map, so the 30+ files aren't duplicated in
the README (source of truth: the `rules-src/*.md` themselves and their `README.md`).

Design and rationale: `.ultrapowers/archive/specs/2026-07-12-stack-rules-design.md` (outside the
distribution); risks — `RISK-STACKRULES-001/002` in `.ultrapowers/RISK_REGISTER.md`.

## What each hook does and why

- **deny-curated-claude-md.mjs** (PreToolUse: `Edit|Write|MultiEdit`). Blocks edits to any
  `CLAUDE.md` that contains the marker line — **no hardcoded path** for `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
  inside the hook (there used to be one; removed so there's only one source of truth). Your
  global file's protection rests on `setup.mjs` guaranteeing it the marker on every run (see
  "Project auto-init" — the same principle now applies to a project's root `CLAUDE.md` too).
  Why a hook, not a rule: `CLAUDE.md` loads as context, and a project one overrides the user's
  — prose can't hold an invariant, but a hook fires before the write and can't be talked
  around by a prompt.
- **protected-guard.mjs** (PreToolUse: `Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit|Bash`). Refuses to
  edit, delete or move any path listed in a `.protected` file — `.gitignore` format, binding at
  its own directory and every level below. Reading is untouched and copying **from** a protected
  path is allowed; `cp` is judged by direction, and a command that cannot be parsed but mentions
  a protected path is denied, since that is where a lost file is most likely. Creating a file
  that does not exist yet is allowed even under a matching rule: the prohibition reads "edit,
  delete or move" and creation is none of them — otherwise a phase could not write its own spec.
  Overwriting an existing file stays denied, and "delete it, then create it again" is not a way
  around that, because the deletion is refused. Two rules are
  intrinsic rather than list entries: `.protected` may be edited but never deleted, and a
  `.protected` that `.gitignore` would hide denies every write in its scope — a protection
  living on one machine is not a project rule — with `.gitignore` and `.protected` themselves
  left writable so the repair is possible. A nested `.protected` may extend **or** override what
  it inherits, which means it can also unprotect: that escape hatch is deliberate and known.
- **decision-records-nudge.mjs** (PreToolUse: `Bash`). On a `git commit` that stages the risk
  register, an ADR or the glossary, runs the matching lint and prints what is wrong together with
  the command that fixes it. **Never blocks** — an unnormalised register is untidy, not
  dangerous — and any error exits 0 silently. It reads the staged index, never the commit
  message, so a message that happens to mention a record does not trip it. The three CLIs behind
  it are `bin/risks.mjs` (`lint`, `normalize`, `add`), `bin/adr.mjs` (`new`, `lint`) and
  `bin/glossary.mjs` (`lint`, `suggest`).
- **secrets-gate.mjs** (PreToolUse: `Bash`). On `git commit`, scans `git diff --cached`: AWS
  keys, private keys, Slack/GitHub tokens, creds in connection strings, explicit secret
  assignments (env references are filtered out, for fewer false positives). If `gitleaks` is
  installed, it's used additionally. The baseline regex always works, no dependencies.
- **db-live-access-gate.mjs** (PreToolUse: `Bash|^mcp__.*`). Live connected DBs are read-only
  by default: any query outside SELECT/WITH/SHOW/DESCRIBE/EXPLAIN is blocked (exit 2); a
  recognized read-only query still requires manual confirmation via "ask", even in a
  bypass-permissions session. Lives under `PreToolUse` with the other gates — not under
  `SessionStart`, that event isn't tied to a tool call and would never fire.
- **worktree-executor-discipline-advisor.mjs** (PreToolUse: `Bash|Read`). Purely **advisory** —
  never blocks or asks, every path resolves to `allow`. Two independent, cheap single-pass stdin
  checks bundled in one file: **(1) parallel-worktree discipline** (`Bash` only, gated on the cwd
  looking like an agent worktree `.claude/worktrees/agent-*`) — catches `pnpm/npm/yarn install`
  (full per-worktree reinstall; on Windows also EPERM under concurrent installs even with the
  shared store), a test-runner invocation with no visible scoping flag (the full suite × number of
  worktrees — observed costing tens of minutes per worker), and a bare `git status` (hangs for
  minutes on a large `node_modules` even with a correct `.gitignore` — use `git diff --stat HEAD`
  instead); it backs up with a harness-level nudge what `gsd-executor.md` only holds in prose (see
  patches below). **(2) large-`Read` backstop** (any session, no worktree gate) — context-mode's
  own one-shot nudge fires at most once per session then goes quiet; this backstop re-fires on
  every large Read, covering what the one-shot missed. Heuristic, not exhaustive: false negatives
  are expected and fine (a nudge, not a gate), any parse failure → silent passthrough.
- **graphify-global-sync.mjs** (PostToolUse: `Bash`) + **hooks/lib/graphify-global-sync-run.mjs**
  (shared worker). After a `git commit` made by Claude via the Bash tool, in the background
  (detached, doesn't block the session), refreshes this project's entry in the cross-project
  `~/.graphify/global-graph.json` (`graphify extract . --code-only --global --as <name>` — local
  AST, no LLM key and no cost). No-op if
  `graphify` isn't installed, if it's not a `git commit`, or if the commit didn't succeed. A
  PID/mtime lock at `~/.claude/state/graphify-sync-<name>.lock` keeps concurrent triggers from
  spawning parallel extractions; the lock is considered stale after 10 minutes.
  **Limitation:** Claude Code hooks only see tool calls Claude itself makes — a manual
  `git commit`/`--amend` from a terminal or IDE is invisible to this hook in principle. That's
  what the native git hook below closes. Disable both: `CLAUDE_GRAPHIFY_AUTOSYNC=0`.
- **gsd-config-patch.mjs** (PostToolUse: `Write|Edit|MultiEdit|Bash`). When a project has a
  `.planning/config.json`, applies my personal defaults once: **tier 1** — overwrites ONLY
  `model_profile`/`models`/`model_overrides`; **tier 2** — `DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_CONFIG` (nested keys
  merge key-by-key, siblings stay untouched). After the first apply each tier is a permanent no-op
  for that project (later manual edits win; state keys shared with `session-init.mjs`'s
  `~/.claude/state/project-init.json`). It listens on all four tools, not `SessionStart`, because
  gsd-core may create the config mid-session (via Claude's Write/Edit or a shelled-out script) —
  so it checks filesystem state after the fact; a cheap no-op on unrelated tool calls. The full
  per-key decision log (what's patched and what's deliberately NOT) lives in
  `docs/gsd-config-defaults.md`. Toggles: `CLAUDE_GSD_CONFIG_AUTOPATCH=0` (both tiers),
  `CLAUDE_GSD_CONFIG_AUTOPATCH_WORKFLOW=0` (tier 2 only).
- **session-init.mjs** (SessionStart). Project bootstrap (see above — most steps are now
  every-session, idempotent) +
  an **independent** (not tied to the shared `firstTime`, so it also fires on projects
  initialized in the past) one-time step: registers the project in graphify's global graph AND
  installs a native `<repo>/.git/hooks/post-commit` that calls the same
  `graphify-global-sync-run.mjs` — git itself invokes this hook, on ANY commit (manual, from an
  IDE, `--amend`), independent of Claude Code. If a `post-commit` already exists (husky,
  pre-commit, graphify's own local hook) — it's appended to, not overwritten. Same toggle:
  `CLAUDE_GRAPHIFY_AUTOSYNC=0`.
  A separate `additionalContext` hint (not a mutation, every session): when the leanmode dial
  for the project isn't `off`, reminds me (the assistant) of a standing convention every
  session — before dispatching any subagent via the Agent tool, resolve its effective level
  (`resolveEffectiveLevel(subagentType, root)`) and announce it in one line right before the
  tool call: fold `(leanmode=<level>)` into whatever narration I'm already about to write (a
  GSD wave/dispatch line, an Ultrapowers `Subagent (type): "task"` line) instead of a second
  line; the standalone template `Запускаю суб-агента <type> (<model>) в режиме
  (leanmode=<level>)` is only for when nothing else narrates that launch. Why prose instead of
  a hook: the launch banner (`agent_type(description) Model`) is drawn by the harness before
  any hook runs, and `SubagentStart`'s own `systemMessage` (sent by `inject-axes.mjs`, see below)
  is empirically confirmed to never render anywhere — prose is the only channel left to
  surface the level before the banner appears. Same toggle: `CLAUDE_LEANMODE=0`.
  One more `additionalContext` hint (also every session, not a mutation): the stack-rules
  snapshot existence check — a plain `existsSync`; `hooks/lib/stack-rules-check.mjs` is not
  called here (it runs inside `/init-stack`). See the "Stack rules (stack-rules)" section
  above. Toggle: `CLAUDE_STACK_RULES=0`.
- **token-usage-log.mjs** (`SubagentStop` + `Stop`) + **hooks/lib/token-usage-shared.mjs**,
  **hooks/lib/token-usage-pricing-refresh.mjs**. After every sub-agent completion and after
  every main-agent turn, appends a line (JSONL) with task/agent/model/tokens/date/cost estimate
  to **both** logs — `<project>/.claude/token-usage.jsonl` (kept forever, never pruned) and
  `~/.claude/state/token-usage.jsonl` (cross-project). This hook only appends — retention for
  the global log (**hooks/lib/token-usage-prune.mjs**: a union of no older than 3 calendar
  months from the last entry / the last-but-one day of activity / a minimum of 10 entries) runs
  FROM SessionStart (see above), not from here — moved 2026-07-13. Sub-agent logging originally
  relied on a second `PostToolUse:Agent` call with
  `status:"completed"` — a 2026-07-10 investigation found that event never arrives (every Agent
  call, backgrounded or not, reports `"async_launched"` and `PostToolUse:Agent` never fires
  again for it), so no `kind:"subagent"` record was ever written. Replaced with `SubagentStop`:
  data comes from `agent_transcript_path` (a transcript file dedicated to that one sub-agent)
  via a saved byte cursor keyed **per agent_id** (not per session — the same agent can
  `SubagentStop` more than once if resumed via `SendMessage`); for the main turn — from
  `transcript_path` via a saved byte cursor keyed per session (a known caveat: the transcript
  can lag slightly on write, so in rare cases the turn's last API call is only counted on the
  next `Stop`). The `cost_usd` estimate is best-effort, from the
  `~/.claude/state/model-pricing.json` pricing table, which refreshes itself once a day by
  scraping the public pricing page (there's no official pricing API — see
  `RISK-TOKENLOG-001`). To view aggregates — the `/token-usage` skill (`--global` for the
  cross-project log, `--week`/`--month`/`--all` for the period; defaults to the current project
  over the last 24h). Toggles: `CLAUDE_TOKEN_USAGE_LOG=0` (disable entirely),
  `CLAUDE_TOKEN_USAGE_COST=0` (no cost estimate and no background price refresh),
  `CLAUDE_TOKEN_USAGE_PRUNE=0` (don't prune the global log).
- **inject-axes.mjs** (`SessionStart` + `SubagentStart`) + **hooks/lib/inject-axes.mjs** — the
  universal rule injector. There is no matcher in `settings.json`: the hook receives the whole
  event and resolves every **axis** in the `AXES` registry independently, and only the blocks
  whose level is not `off` go into `additionalContext`. Axes never reference one another, so
  disabling one never affects another, and a new one is a single registry entry. Two axes today:
  - **leanmode** (`hooks/lib/leanmode-rules.mjs`, `SubagentStart` only) — a first-party
    replacement for the third-party `ponytail` plugin: before a subagent starts, keyed on its
    `agent_type`, injects a YAGNI ("write minimal code") text — but not evenly:
    `DEFAULT_LEANMODE_MAP` assigns `off/lite/full` per `agent_type` individually (11 of ~40
    non-`off`; everything else is deliberately `off` — agents that don't write code at all, like
    `gsd-planner`/`gsd-security-auditor`, never get this injection). On top of that: per-project
    overrides (`.claude/leanmode.json`) and a project-wide dial (`off/lite/full/ultra`, set via
    the `/leanmode` command) that **shifts** the map rather than replacing it — `off` is pinned
    and never moves either direction under the shift (full design rationale and map:
    `.ultrapowers/archive/specs/2026-07-10-leanmode-design.md`, outside the distribution). The
    dial defaults to `full` once `/init-stack` has run at least once for a project (the
    `initStackRun` flag in `~/.claude/state/project-init.json`, set by
    **hooks/lib/mark-initstack-done.mjs**, called as `/init-stack`'s step 7 — not a registered
    hook on its own); otherwise `off`. Toggle: `CLAUDE_LEANMODE=0`.
  - **verbosity** (`hooks/lib/verbosity-rules.mjs`, both events) — terseness of **comments and
    blank lines** in generated code, and nothing else: names, mandatory syntax, indentation,
    error handling at real boundaries and validation are untouched; this is not minification.
    One project dial in `.claude/verbosity.json` (`off/lite/full/ultra`, the **`/aidev`**
    command) applies uniformly to the main loop and to every subagent, with optional per-agent
    overrides — deliberately no per-`agent_type` base map here: unlike code structure, comment
    verbosity is the same across every code-writing context. Toggle: `CLAUDE_VERBOSITY=0`.

  The hook also emits a `systemMessage` naming the active axes alongside `additionalContext` —
  kept in the source in case the harness renders it.
  Empirically (2026-07-11, three real subagent launches, debug-log instrumentation; back then
  this was a separate `leanmode-subagent.mjs` hook, whose job the leanmode axis now does)
  confirmed: in the orchestrator's own thread, `SubagentStart`'s `systemMessage` doesn't show
  up — not on the banner (which the harness draws before hooks run and can't be rewritten
  regardless), not as a separate line there either. The level is surfaced to the orchestrator
  in practice through a separate mechanism — see `session-init.mjs` above. Separate, not yet
  re-confirmed via debug-log:
  one observation showed a line `SubagentStart:<type> says: <message>` inside a backgrounded
  subagent's own expanded transcript (`↓ to expand`) — plausibly a different render location
  for `systemMessage` (not the parent thread), not a contradiction of the finding above.

The "background-task supervision" family. Shared idea: a hung background job NEVER exits, so
`run_in_background` never re-invokes me — these turn a hang into a guaranteed completion event:

- **bg-supervision-nudge.mjs** (PreToolUse: `Bash`). When a command is launched with
  `run_in_background` but isn't wrapped in a supervisor (`supervise-bg.mjs`/`gh run watch`/
  `timeout`) and doesn't look like a long-lived server (`dev`/`serve`/`start`/`--watch`/
  `nodemon`/`vite`/`next dev` — a wall-clock watchdog would wrongly kill those), injects a
  non-blocking reminder to wrap it in `bin/supervise-bg.mjs` (`--stale`/`--timeout`/`--label`) —
  then a stall/timeout kills the job and returns a completion event. Fail-open: any error → exit 0.
- **ci-watch-nudge.mjs** (PostToolUse: `Bash`). After a `git push` in a repo with GitHub Actions
  (`.github/workflows` up the tree), reminds me to watch CI to completion with a backgrounded
  `gh run watch <id> --exit-status` — which EXITS when CI finishes (pass/fail) and thereby
  re-invokes me: "did CI pass?" becomes a guaranteed push event instead of something I must
  remember to poll. The git-command parse honestly handles the value-flags `-C`/`-c` and chains
  via `&&`/`||`/`;`/`|`. Fail-open.
A stub that **no profile installs** (`variants.json → alwaysExclude`):
`hooks/task-lifecycle-probe*` — the `TaskCreated`/`TaskCompleted` schema probe. Both events are
in the public docs, but whether they're wired in the current harness build is unconfirmed, so
the probe only appends one line per firing and decides nothing. It stays in the repo: to use it,
register it by hand.

Not a hook in the `hooks.*` sense (a different `settings.json` mechanism — the top-level
`statusLine` key, not the `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`/event hooks above), but the same "a script
from this bundle, driving your Claude Code" principle — here for findability:

- **statusline.mjs** (`statusLine.command`, registered — see "How the installer works" above;
  **all three profiles** — `full`, `base`, `lite` — one renderer instead of the former choice
  between wrapping gsd-core's `gsd-statusline.js` and base/lite's own renderer; the deleted
  `gsd-context-meter.mjs` was that wrapper). The line renders itself, with no subprocess at all —
  six segments left to right, joined by a dim `│`:
  1. **pending component updates**, by **name** (`⬆ context-mode graphify`), leftmost — not a
     count, and not on the right the way the deleted wrapper appended it;
  2. **model** — `data.model.display_name` from the statusLine payload;
  3. **context** — tokens and percent, e.g. `165.6K/1M 17%`, coloured and iconed by two separate
     ladders: **colour** — by percent of the model window (00–15 grey / 16–30 green / 31–55
     yellow / 56–80 orange / 81–100 red), **icon** — left of the digits and outside the colour
     wrapper, by percent of the way to automatic compaction (00–39 no icon / 40–59 💡 / 60–74 ❗ /
     75–89 🔥 / 90–100 💀; each one `Emoji_Presentation=Yes`, or xterm.js renders a monochrome
     glyph). Both ladders compare the rounded percent — the one the line prints. The capacity is
     `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW` when set,
     capped at the model's window, otherwise the model's window whole; within that capacity the
     autocompact point resolves in this order: `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE` → an observation
     from `precompact-observe.mjs` for the current model (`~/.claude/state/autocompact.json`) →
     the capacity itself. The default is never a guessed reserve;
  4. **project** — the directory name only, no git branch;
  5. **gsd work status** — only when gsd-core is installed **and** active for this project
     (`<claudeDir>/gsd-core/VERSION` exists **and** `<root>/.planning/config.json` exists);
  6. **ultrapowers work status** — on every profile except `lite`. The profile is read from
     `~/.claude/state/bundle-manifest.json`; an absent or unreadable manifest fails **open** (the
     segment shows) — only `lite` suppresses it.

  Segment 6 selects a phase deterministically: `.ultrapowers/ROADMAP.md`'s frontmatter `current`,
  else the single phase whose `status: running`. Zero or several matches means the tree does not
  know which phase is in flight, and the segment renders the tally rather than guessing.

  It has **three modes**, switched wholesale rather than by substituting parts:

  - **executing** — `09 2/1/3 — phase-progress-segment`: done, in work, queued. A fourth number
    is appended only when something is blocked, `09 2/1/3/1`. Done is green, the in-work position
    is cyan — or **yellow** when any task is in a fix round — the queue is uncoloured and blocked
    is red. Only the numbers are painted, never the separators.
  - **named action** — `09 (planning) phase-progress-segment`, cyan, or red when the phase is
    `blocked`. A phase with no `action` prints its id and name alone; the bar never invents a word
    for what is happening.
  - **tally** — `8/10 phase-progress-segment` between phases: every phase except `abandoned` ones,
    named after the highest-numbered one.

  The counters come from the **live SDD ledger** for the resolved phase, read structurally by
  counting `task-N-brief.md` against `task-N-report.md` — no line of its prose is parsed, so its
  wording can change freely. `NN-STATE.md` supplies `action`, `tasks_fixing` and `tasks_blocked`;
  with no ledger present it answers alone. A ledger belonging to any other phase is never
  consulted, which is what the bar used to get wrong: it picked by mtime, so a checkout could
  change what it claimed and a finished plan's tally could be presented as live work.

  Still **never a percentage**: a phase that retires a task states its tally in fields and its
  reason in prose, and a derived percentage would under-report an already-finished phase.

  Same key property throughout: any single source's error costs only its own segment, never the
  whole line — empty output and exit 0, the statusline never breaks.

All hooks are Node-based and registered in **exec form** (`command: "node"`, `args: [abs.
path]`): no shell, so they work on Windows without Git Bash too, with no `$HOME` or
line-ending issues.

## Cross-tool gsd-core patches (agents, workflow, tool-grant)

The files `~/.claude/agents/gsd-*.md` and `~/.claude/gsd-core/workflows/execute-phase.md` belong
to the **separate `gsd-core` tool** (`npx @opengsd/gsd-core@latest`), not this bundle. The set still maintains
them — best-effort, idempotent, with versioned markers
`<!-- gsd-patch:ID vN -->…<!-- /gsd-patch:ID -->` (content-aware, not presence-aware: on a patch
version bump the stale text is replaced with the fresh one, not skipped). Three mechanisms with
different write policies, deliberately:

- **Silent, self-healing tool-grant sync** — `hooks/lib/context-mode-gsd-agents.mjs`. Adds the
  context-mode MCP tool to the `tools:` frontmatter of `gsd-*.md` agents, but ONLY when the
  context-mode plugin is actually installed and enabled (otherwise the agent would reference a
  nonexistent MCP server). It's a single frontmatter line, so it's safe to run EVERY session —
  including after gsd-core's own updater rewrites an agent and drops the tool again. Called from
  `session-init.mjs` and from the CLI wrapper `sync-gsd-context-mode-tool.mjs` (invoked by
  `setup.mjs` and `init-stack.mjs`).
- **Review-gated content patches** — `hooks/lib/gsd-agent-patches.mjs` (30+ agents: routing to
  context-mode tools, hardening `gsd-executor.md`/`gsd-debugger.md`, a guardrail against recursive
  spawning — including a bounded-Agent guardrail for `gsd-debug-session-manager.md`, the one agent
  that keeps `Agent` (to spawn `gsd-debugger`), where instead of a ban it truthfully documents the
  depth-2 cap) and `hooks/lib/gsd-hook-patches.mjs` (one line in
  `hooks/gsd-agent-isolation-guard.js`: gsd-core's guard knows only its own executor, and this
  bundle ships a second one). Choosing `gsd-executor` vs `gsd-executor-decomposing` is no longer a
  patch of ours — it is gsd-core's own per-plan `agent_hint`. Unlike tool-grant this
  is **not written silently**: the patches inject prose across dozens of files, so a human first
  reviews what's about to land. `session-init.mjs` checks them **read-only** every session
  (`checkGsd…Patches`) and prints a hint if something is pending. It's applied only by an explicit
  human invocation: the **`/init-session`** command (`apply-gsd-agent-patches.mjs`, applies BOTH
  sets — agent + workflow — at once) — init-stack.md no longer has an equivalent step. After a gsd-core update the
  patches expectedly "fall off" (their files were rewritten by the native updater) —
  `session-init` notices and offers `/init-session` again. The patches are tied to a specific
  gsd-core version's format: markers verified against the installed **1.8.0** (on a future
  release reformatting the block, a patch degrades to "no anchor found" — skipped, never a
  corrupt write).
- **Bundle release check** — `hooks/lib/config-update-check-run.mjs`. A detached worker that
  `session-init.mjs` spawns and immediately unrefs (never blocks the session). It compares the SHA
  in `~/.claude/state/bundle-manifest.json` (what `setup.mjs` last installed) against the current
  master on GitHub (public API, no auth, nothing sent) and reports ONLY good news — that an update
  is available; every failure (offline, rate-limit, corporate proxy) is swallowed silently, like
  every other background bundle check. The verdict lands in
  `~/.claude/state/component-updates.json` and is re-checked at most once per 24h, so `setup.mjs`
  reconciles that file against the SHA it just installed (`reconcileBundleInstall`) — otherwise the
  banner would keep asking for an installer run that already happened until the window expired.

## Required tools and fallback

The installer checks and suggests the install command for your OS:

- **node** — required; guaranteed by Claude Code itself. Hooks need nothing else to run.
- **git** — needed by `secrets-gate.mjs`. If missing: `secrets-gate` becomes a no-op (a commit
  won't run without git anyway), everything else works. Install: `apt/dnf` ·
  `winget`/`choco`/`scoop` · `brew`.
- **gitleaks** — optional. Without it, the built-in regex still works. Install:
  `winget`/`choco` · release binary · `brew`.
- **gh** (GitHub CLI) — optional, needed only by `ci-watch-nudge.mjs` for `gh run watch` after a
  `git push`. Without it the nudge simply has no useful effect (the hook itself is fail-open,
  breaks nothing). Install: `winget`/`choco`/`scoop` · `brew` · `apt/dnf`.

## PowerShell tool on Windows (optional, one-time opt-in in setup.mjs)

Claude Code can work through a PowerShell tool instead of/alongside Bash on Windows
(`CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL=1` in `env`, optionally `"defaultShell": "powershell"` — also
switches interactive `!` commands). Officially documented on docs.claude.com, but this is a
**preview feature, still "rolling out progressively"**, and it has significant limitations:

- **auto-mode isn't supported** — every PowerShell command requires manual confirmation, even
  in an auto-approve/bypass-permissions session. That is why the key is **not** in
  `settings.partial.json`: from there it would be re-asserted on every run, and any
  already-configured auto-approved Windows session would silently start asking for
  confirmation on every command after a plain `node setup.mjs`.
- `$PROFILE` (aliases/functions) isn't picked up.
- no sandboxing, which the Bash tool has access to via WSL2.
- execution policy can block scripts.
- the pipeline returns objects, not text — awk/sed-style result parsing doesn't work.

This doesn't affect the package's hooks at all — they're all Node in exec form
(`command: "node"`), they need no shell. It only affects commands Claude itself runs in a
session (git, npm, etc.).

### What setup.mjs does

On Windows, `setup.mjs` asks about this key **once** and remembers the answer — the same
pattern as `CLAUDE_CONFIG_UPDATE_CHECK`. In order:

1. It looks for PowerShell 7+ (`pwsh`). Windows PowerShell 5.1 (`powershell.exe`) is a
   different product and does not count.
2. If it isn't there, it offers to install it with
   `winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell`. Declining the install records nothing: the offer
   comes back next run rather than hardening into a recorded "no".
3. With PowerShell 7+ present it asks about the tool itself and writes `"1"` on yes or `"0"`
   on no into `~/.claude/settings.json`.

A recorded decision is final in both directions: while the key is in `env`, `setup.mjs` never
asks again, however many times it runs. Changed your mind — edit or delete the key in
`~/.claude/settings.json` by hand.

A run without a TTY asks nothing: enable it explicitly with
`node setup.mjs --enable-powershell-tool` (which also requires `pwsh` to be installed already
and never installs anything itself).

```json
{ "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL": "1" } }
```

and, if you also want to switch interactive `!` commands: `"defaultShell": "powershell"` at
the top level — `setup.mjs` does not touch that. Details:
[PowerShell tool](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/tools-reference#powershell-tool).

---

## Post-install check

- `/hooks` — the list should show two PreToolUse entries and one SessionStart.
- Ask Claude to edit your marked `CLAUDE.md` → should be denied.
- In a repo with an unmarked `.planning/CLAUDE.md` and a `RISK_REGISTER.md`, the first session
  should add the per-project exclude and a risk line. (full variant only, see "Bundle variants")
- Stage a file with an obviously hardcoded key (a line like `api_key = "<16 hex chars>"`) and
  ask Claude to `git commit` → denied; a clean change goes through.

## Codebase knowledge graph (graphify) + a shared graph across all projects

[graphify](https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify) builds a queryable knowledge graph over
code/docs. The PyPI package is **`graphifyy`** (double `y`), the CLI is `graphify`.

### Install / check (+ extra components, + uv auto-setup)

A cross-platform installer (ASCII output - doesn't crash under cp1251). **If `uv` is missing -
it first tries any already-installed `pipx`/`pip` (without installing anything), and only asks
for your consent** (`[y/N]`) before installing `uv` itself: Windows - `winget` (id
`astral-sh.uv`) -> `scoop`/`choco` -> the official PowerShell installer; macOS - `brew`/`curl`;
Linux - `curl`/`wget` -> `pipx`/`pip`. On a decline with no alternatives it asks once more, on a
second decline it skips the install. `--yes` - auto-consent (for CI). After installing, it
**verifies the tool is actually callable** (a common issue - PATH): if `uv` got installed but
isn't yet on the current session's PATH - open a new terminal.

```
node ~/.claude/bin/graphify-setup.mjs             # uv (if needed) + graphifyy[pdf,office,sql,mcp] + the /graphify skill
node ~/.claude/bin/graphify-setup.mjs --all       # ALL tools: uv tool install "graphifyy[all]"
node ~/.claude/bin/graphify-setup.mjs --extras=pdf,office,sql,postgres,mcp
node ~/.claude/bin/graphify-setup.mjs --doctor    # python, uv, winget/scoop/choco/brew/curl, graphify, global graph
node ~/.claude/bin/graphify-setup.mjs --bootstrap-uv   # just install uv
node ~/.claude/bin/graphify-setup.mjs --no-bootstrap   # don't install uv, use pipx/pip if present
node ~/.claude/bin/graphify-setup.mjs --dry-run   # show the commands, run nothing
```

`--doctor` shows upfront what's available (e.g.: `uv: on PATH`, `winget: available`,
`curl/wget: curl`), to see whether bootstrapping is needed. Useful extras: `pdf, office, sql,
postgres, terraform, mcp, video, all` (Delphi `.pas/.dpr` and SQL are supported out of the box).

### The whole codebase at once, not project by project

Uses graphify's **global graph** - a single cross-project file where every repo's graph gets
registered:

```
node ~/.claude/bin/graphify-setup.mjs --build-global /path/repoA /path/repoB /path/repoC
```

Under the hood, per repository: `graphify extract <repo> --global --as <name>`. Management -
`graphify global list | remove <name> | path`.

**Search by meaning** - `node ~/.claude/bin/graph-semantic.mjs "<question>"`, ~1 s. Answers "have
I written something like this before?" when the name cannot be guessed: "a lock that stops two
processes" finds the mutex, where full-text search returned an app's PIN lock screen. Vectors are
built by `/graphify-build-docs` (~2 min, 24 MB): `bin/graph-docs.mjs --build` harvests the
comment above every symbol in the global graph into a single markdown corpus, and the embeddings
are built over that. The environment is created once in `~/.graphify/embed-venv` and graphify's
own is left alone.

**The mass sync** skips nested archive copies with `--skip-nested-archives` (off by default): only
the pair "nested in another project" AND "archival name" counts - nesting alone catches monorepo
packages, the name alone catches a legitimate project called `backup`.

**Cross-repository symbol lookup** - `node ~/.claude/bin/graph-find.mjs "<symbol>"`. Answers in
~200 ms from the flat index at `~/.graphify/global-index.tsv`; the same question through
`graphify explain --graph ~/.graphify/global-graph.json` takes ~4.5 s, because it re-parses the
whole graph. The index rebuilds in the tail of each commit's sync; `--build` forces it. The same
symbol in the same file across repositories (worktree copies) collapses into one hit that names
them all.

### Where the result is stored and how it's available in any project

- **File:** `~/.graphify/global-graph.json` (cross-project, outside any specific repo).
- **Query from ANY project** (even a new one), without wiring up individually:
```
  graphify query "where is auth validated?" --graph ~/.graphify/global-graph.json
  graphify path "UserService" "DatabasePool" --graph ~/.graphify/global-graph.json
```
- **Claude knows about this in every project:** the curated `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` has a
  "CODEBASE KNOWLEDGE GRAPH" section added, which tells it to query the global graph first for
  architecture/cross-repo questions instead of grepping files. User memory loads in any
  project.
- **(Optional) a user-level MCP** - structured access (`query_graph`, `get_node`,
  `shortest_path`, ...) across all Claude Code projects:
```
  node ~/.claude/bin/graphify-setup.mjs --mcp
```
  Registers a user-scope `graphify-global` MCP server on top of `~/.graphify/global-graph.json`
  (needs the `claude` CLI; if `uv` is present, it runs through an isolated environment).

You can still graph a project locally as before (`/graphify .` - result in `graphify-out/`):
for "just this repo" questions its own graph is more convenient, for cross-repo questions - the
global one.

### Auto-registering a new project + auto-refresh on commit

`global-graph.json` used to be filled in entirely by hand (`--build-global` /
`graphify-sync-all.mjs`). Now it happens on its own, if `graphify` is installed (toggle for
both steps — `CLAUDE_GRAPHIFY_AUTOSYNC=0`):

- **New project** — on Claude's first session in the project, `session-init.mjs` queues a
  one-time background `graphify extract . --global --as <name>`, adding the project to the
  shared graph. Part of the one-time bootstrap, like `CLAUDE.md` auto-marking.
- **Accumulated knowledge is visible right away, not just on query** — at that same one-time
  moment, BEFORE queuing its own registration, `session-init.mjs` synchronously (cheap: a local
  JSON read, no LLM call) calls `graphify global list` and drops a preview of the already
  accumulated repos into the session's `additionalContext`. The point: a new project should
  learn, on its very first session, that work/patterns already exist elsewhere that can be
  reused via `graphify query ... --graph ~/.graphify/global-graph.json`, rather than relying
  solely on Claude remembering to read the CODEBASE KNOWLEDGE GRAPH section in CLAUDE.md.
  Best-effort (see the warning in the file header about `additionalContext`), so this
  supplements, not replaces, the static instruction in CLAUDE.md.
- **Every commit** — via two paths, both calling the same
  `hooks/lib/graphify-global-sync-run.mjs`:
  1. `hooks/graphify-global-sync.mjs` (PostToolUse on `Bash`) — catches commits Claude makes
     via the Bash tool. Needs no per-project install, works from the first session.
  2. A native `<repo>/.git/hooks/post-commit`, which `session-init.mjs` installs once per
     project — git itself invokes it on ANY commit: manual, from an IDE, `--amend`. This is the
     only path that sees commits not made by Claude.
  Both are detached, don't block the session/commit; a per-project lock file keeps concurrent
  triggers from spawning parallel extractions.

The manual path (`--build-global`, `node graphify-sync-all.mjs --install-hooks`) still exists —
useful for a one-off bulk import of existing repos or a forced full re-sync.
`graphify-sync-all.mjs` — Node-based (cross-platform, Windows/Linux/macOS): walks projects
under `--root` (defaults to the current folder) up to `--max-depth`, registers each one in the
shared graph, with `--install-hooks` it installs the per-repo hook. Doesn't install anything
itself — if `graphify` isn't on PATH, it prints how to get it and exits.

### `graphify claude install` — the official "always consult the graph" hook mechanism

Separately from the global registration, `session-init.mjs` once (its own independent flag
`graphifyClaudeInstalled`, same pattern as `graphifySynced`) calls `graphify claude install`
for the CURRENT project — this is graphify's official mechanism: a section in the project's
`CLAUDE.md` + a PreToolUse hook that itself nudges Claude toward `graphify query` before a
grep/Read scan of files, instead of relying on Claude remembering to read the prose in
CLAUDE.md.

**An important security nuance:** `graphify claude install` writes into the project's
`CLAUDE.md` via a plain CLI process — bypassing Claude's Edit/Write tools, and therefore
bypassing `deny-curated-claude-md.mjs` (which only matches on the tools themselves). So this
step:

- runs STRICTLY before the root `CLAUDE.md` auto-mark step (see above) — on a new project's
  first session the file isn't curated yet, graphify gets one chance to append its section,
  AFTER which auto-marking immediately locks the file in as curated;
- on a retrofit of an older project (auto-marking already ran in the past) — before calling it,
  `CURATED:NOEDIT` is always checked; if the file is already curated, the step is skipped and
  leaves a note in `additionalContext` recommending you run the command by hand and review the
  diff yourself.

Optionally disable just this step (global-graph registration keeps working):
`CLAUDE_GRAPHIFY_CLAUDE_INSTALL=0`.

### Auto-updating components (context-mode, graphify, the bundle itself, the design stack)

Every session `session-init.mjs` spawns the detached worker
`hooks/lib/component-update-check-run.mjs` (doesn't block the session, 24h throttle per
component, verdicts in `~/.claude/state/component-updates.json`). What is checked and how comes
from the **registry** `hooks/lib/component-registry.mjs`, which replaced the old `KNOWN_TOOLS`
list inside `session-init.mjs` — a new component is one registry entry:

| component | scope | how it updates |
|---|---|---|
| `context-mode` | machine | `context-mode upgrade` — its own subcommand (pulls the latest from GitHub, rebuilds, reinstalls hooks) |
| `graphify` | machine | `uv tool upgrade graphifyy` — it has no update command of its own; this is the path from its own README, and only with `uv` on PATH |
| `claude-config` | machine | the bundle itself: the manifest's SHA against master on GitHub. Updating means you running `setup.mjs`; nothing installs itself |
| `impeccable` | project | skill version; after an update the Pro Max graft is re-applied (`impeccable-promax-graft.mjs`) |
| `ui-ux-pro-max` | project | skill version |

Components classed `safe` update themselves in the background; class `reinit` (the bundle) only
reports, because a reinstall is a human decision. What is waiting shows at the left of the
status line, by name (`⬆ context-mode graphify`) rather than as a count.

Toggles: `CLAUDE_COMPONENT_AUTOUPDATE=0` (all of it), `CLAUDE_COMPONENT_AUTOUPDATE_<NAME>=0`
(per-component, dashes → underscores, e.g. `CLAUDE_COMPONENT_AUTOUPDATE_CONTEXT_MODE=0`). The
older `CLAUDE_TOOL_AUTOUPGRADE[_<NAME>]=0` still works for `context-mode` and `graphify` — those
registry entries remember their legacy variable. Accepted risk: an update might still be writing
in the background while the same session's first tool calls already use the tool — the same
trade-off already accepted for the background `graphify extract` above.

## Other / limitations

- Hooks only fire inside Claude Code sessions. Your manual commits and edits in a terminal
  aren't affected — that's by design.
- `permissions.deny` for `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — a secondary, dependency-free layer; the main
  protection is the Node hook (which also catches the marker at any location).
- Rules in `secrets-gate.mjs` can be tuned to your stack — they constrain Claude's commits.
- `settings.partial.json` isn't just a reference file: `setup.mjs` reads it directly as the
  single source of truth for hooks/permissions in `settings.json` (substituting `<HOME>` with
  the real home directory). Edit hooks only here — you don't need to, and shouldn't, touch the
  generated merge inside `setup.mjs` by hand. Also fine for manual insertion if you'd rather
  not rely on the installer. `RISK_REGISTER.snippet.md` is purely a reference, for manual
  insertion.

## Diagnostics: `PreToolUse hook error` / `cannot find module` on every Edit

Symptom: on any file edit, a spam of
`PreToolUse:Edit hook error` + `node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:...`.

Cause: Node can't find the hook file **at the path recorded in `~/.claude/settings.json`** —
the path is stale (left over from an earlier version, including a `.sh` variant) or points at
a different `~`. The hook itself is fine; the problem is the `settings.json` entry.

Check which path is broken:

```
node setup.mjs --doctor
```

Shows `OK` / `MISSING` / `BROKEN` for each registered hook.

Fix it:

```
node setup.mjs
```

The installer now **removes any entries referencing its own hooks itself** (broken paths, old
`.sh`, the wrong home) and writes fresh, correct ones. Your own unrelated hooks aren't touched.
Then — **restart Claude Code**. Run `setup.mjs` as the same user Claude Code runs as
(otherwise `~` diverges again).

To stop the spam instantly before restarting: temporarily set `"disableAllHooks": true` in
`~/.claude/settings.json` (or remove the broken entry from `hooks.PreToolUse` by hand).

## Cyrillic console: character errors (checkmark/dash) and where RISK_REGISTER lives

**Symptom:** on running something (e.g. `/init-stack`), a crash over a non-ASCII character
(the checkmark `✓`, an em dash, etc.) in a terminal with a Cyrillic OEM code page (cp866) or
cp1251.

**Cause:** the console in that encoding can't encode such a character on output — the write to
stdout throws, and the step aborts (which, among other things, could leave `RISK_REGISTER.md`
un-updated).

**What's already been done here:** every script in the package (`setup.mjs`, hooks,
`add-risk.mjs`) outputs **ASCII only** — they don't hit this class of error.

**If your own script/command crashes** (e.g. `/init-stack` prints `✓`):
- simplest — strip the non-ASCII from the output (write `[ok]`/`OK` instead of `✓`, a plain
  hyphen `-` instead of `—`);
- or switch the console to UTF-8 before running:
  - PowerShell: `chcp 65001` or `[Console]::OutputEncoding=[Text.Encoding]::UTF8`;
  - Python tools: the `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` variable;
  - Node outputs UTF-8 on its own — ASCII output or a UTF-8 console is enough.

**Where RISK_REGISTER.md is looked for:** at the project root, at `.ultrapowers/`, at the
`.planning/` root, and in its subfolders (e.g. `.planning/codebase/`). Selection rules:
- if several are found — the **shallowest** one (closest to the root) is used;
- if there are several at that minimal depth — **each one** is updated, each with its own next
  ID.

`add-risk.mjs`:
- a path to a **file** — update exactly that one; a path to a **folder** —
  `<folder>/RISK_REGISTER.md`;
- **no argument** — find and update the register(s) per the rules above (search base is the
  current folder, `--root <dir>` can be given); `--no-create` — create nothing if none exist.

Auto-init (`session-init.mjs`) uses the same logic (with `--no-create`, i.e. only existing
files). The risk-register step runs **every session** and is idempotent — if the register
appeared or moved after the project's first init, the entry gets added on the next startup
automatically. (Root `CLAUDE.md` auto-marking and the per-project exclude are also every
session and idempotent, same reason — see "Project auto-init" above.)

Update a specific register directly:

```
node ~/.claude/add-risk.mjs .planning/codebase/RISK_REGISTER.md
```

Find and update per the rules (from the project root):

```
node ~/.claude/add-risk.mjs
```

The risk register updates itself on every startup — you don't need to delete state for that.
Root `CLAUDE.md` auto-marking and the per-project exclude also don't remember anything in
state either — it's a plain check of the file's current content on every session, so you don't
need to delete state for those either. The entry in `~/.claude/state/project-init.json` is
only needed for truly one-time steps (`graphify claude install`, global-graph registration,
the model_profile patch) — delete it if you need to re-run exactly those.
